materials  sections 12.1, 12.2 Uwe lectures 1 and 2, Webassign intro to vectors assignments

talk about 3D coordinates

projections onto the three coordinate planes

an equation in x,y,z represents a surface (actually, there are exceptions):  certainly, as an equation y = f(x)
represents a surface, an expression z = f(x,y) represents a surface.  And we can define surfaces in other orientations
using equations.

We need to know what context we are in to interpret some equations.  y = 5 is a horizontal line in the usual plane;
it is a surface parallel to the xz plane in 3-space.

We have the distance formula d((x,y,z),(u,v,w)) = sqrt((x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2 + (z-w)^2) which is justified by two
applications of the Pythagorean theorem (try this on the board, with usual self-deprecating remarks about my artwork)

You should recognize (x-u)^2 + (y-v)^2 + (z-w)^2 = r^2 as the equation of a sphere of radius r with center at (u,v,w)
[with the tacit assumption that x,y,z are playing their usual roles as names of the coordinate axes].

I like 12.1 problem 21.  I also like 12.1 problem 22, which does two things at once.

Vector addition

addition and scalar multiplication of vectors, two different formulations:  one rather concrete in terms of effects
on (families of) arrows, the other in terms of coordinates.

length of vectors is another application of the Pythagorean theorem/distance formula.

draw pictures of the operations.

Example 3 is good.

Example 4 is good.

algebraic properties of vectors (note the reasons of type which give us two distributive laws)

The use of i,j,k for the basis vectors (note use of hooks over vectors in boardwork, and boldface
when printed)

<a,b,c> can be written ai+bj+ck

context tells us whether ai+bj lives in the plane or 3-space.

notion of unit vector, example 6


Example 7 (eep!)

videos on lectures:

confusion of vectors with directed line segments = arrows is noted in lecture 1.

vectors are parallel iff one is a scalar multiple of the other

polar coordinate representation of a vector -- in the text used only in Ex 7

a unit 2-vector is (cos(theta), sin(theta))

parametric equations of a line look forward to section 12.5

triangle inequality is an extra
