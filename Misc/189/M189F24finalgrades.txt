ID = test ID on your final exam paper

FI = your grade on the final.  The final was graded in the default way; no adjustments.  The average was 80 and the median 85;  a good performance and no need for adjustments.

CG = course grade.  I gave no +/- grades, and I did look at borderline numbers but felt all of them got the correct letter grade.

It ended up being quite a good semester, I thought, though there were hiccups.  Have a good holiday season!
