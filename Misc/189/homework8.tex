\begin{enumerate}

\item  The sequnce 1,3,17,61,153,311$\ldots$ is defined by a polynomial of degree low enough that the method of differences will detect it correctly with the number of terms I have given.  Indexing starts at 0.  Find the closed form using both methods I have taught, Levin's method with simultaneous equations and my method using binomial coefficients.


\item  Levin section 2.3 problem 12


\item  Find the solution to the recurrence relation $a_{n+2} = -a_{n+1}+6a_n$ with initial values $a_0=1, a_1 = 3$.
\item   Levin section 2.4 problem 11
\item  Prove by mathematical induction that for each natural number $n$, $n^3 + 5n$ is divisible by 3.

\item  Prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first $n$ odd natural numbers is $n^2$.  Start by writing this as a statement in summation notation, then prove it using the recursive definition of summation.

\end{enumerate}
