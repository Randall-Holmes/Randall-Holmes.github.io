<H1>Math 189 section 1, Fall 2023:  Class Resource Page</H1>

Welcome to the fall 2023 first section of Math 189, Discrete Mathematics.<p>

This page provides links to resources for student in this class, including permanent resources and homework assignments, posted as they are developed (and announced here, not necessarily in class).
It will also contain announcements of events in the class (such as exams):  students should be in the habit of looking at this page regularly.<p>

<H2>Office hours:</H2>

MWF 3-4 pm in person in my office.  I'll have Zoom open and may provide additional Zoom office hours.<p>

<H2>Books that we will use</H2>

<A HREF="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html">Discrete Mathematics, an open introduction, by Oscar Levin</a><p>

The entire book is available for free as an <A HREF="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/">interactive online ebook. </a><p>

You can also <A HREF="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/pdfs/dmoi-tablet.pdf">download a PDF</a>.<p>

We will also use <A HREF="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf">these lecture notes</a> by Lovasz and Vesztergombi.<p>

These are free and legal resources.  I also have copies of these books
on my web page, so if there is any web interruption to their availability, we are covered.<p>

<H2>Instructor prepared notes and tools.</H2>

More will appear here as time goes on.<p>

<A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/manualoflogicalstyle23.pdf">My manual of logical style</a>, a resource for learning formal logic and (I hope) a correct style for writing mathematical proofs.<p>

<H2>Scheduled Events:  Announcements, Homework, and Exams</H2>

New items in this section will appear at the top.<p>



<H3> "Paper" homework assignments</H3>

<UL>
I make the remark here that when I talk about homework being done on paper, that doesn't mean that I won't accept homework produced as an electronic file;  it means that
if you do it on paper, I need it scanned and turned in electronically.  Of course it is easy to turn it in electronically if it is an electronic document to begin with.  I am fine with "papers" produced using LaTeX or any other electronic format which supports suitable notation.  I'm also fine with printouts of electronic documents with work by hand added (pictures, for example), scanned and sent to me as usual.<p>

If I don't mention a due date for a paper assignment, it will be due two class sessions after it is assigned, not including exam dates.<p>

Turning something in electronically means sending it by email to <TT>rholmes@boisestate.edu</TT> (until I learn Canvas, I'm planning to do this)<p>

<B>ANOTHER POINT:</B>  Please make sure that the name of each file you send me includes the name of the assignment and your name.   I'll rename files if I need to but it is easier for me if you do it in the first place.<p>

</UL>

<H3>The final examination event</H3>

Test III and the final exam will be given as a merged event in our final exam period, Wed Dec 13 2:30-4:30 pm in our usual room.<p>

As review material, I give you all the exams from the Fall 2022 version of this course.  They had a cumulative final exam;  I gave them a draft exam beforehand, for which I have
a handwritten answer key which I will post later.  (I want you to attempt it without solutions first).<p>

One of the reasons that I posted the hour exams as well as the finals is that I may not make the same choices as to what to include in the cumulative part.  Polynomial fitting or closed forms for sequences defined by recurrence relations might make it into the cumulative part, for example.<p>

Of course the tests from this term are good review material as well.<p>

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/M189F22final.pdf">The final exam given in Fall 2022.</a>  They had a regular cumulative exam.  You should expect the cumulative part to not be as long (5 or 6 questions).  This PDF is missing a picture for
the graph theory question:  I will fix this later.<p>

<LI> <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/M189F22finaldraft.pdf">The draft final exam given in Fall 2022</a>.  I'll post an answer key for this exam later.  Picture needed for the graph theory question.<p>

<LI> <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/finalkey2.pdf">The draft final exam given in Fall 2022</a>.  Here is the answer key.<p>

<LI> <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/M189F22test1.pdf">The first test given in Fall 2022</a><p>

<LI> <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/test2withpics.pdf">The second test given in Fall 2022</a><p>.    This one has graph theory pictures.  This one is similar in coverage to the Test 3 part of the coming event.  There will be fewer questions, and we will not have as much time with the graph theory.  You should think in terms of four or five questions in the Test 3 part.<p>

<LI> <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/M189F23test1sols.pdf">answer key to your first test</a>.<p>

</UL>

For the record, I promised at the test review (thanks for your patience with the Zoom format, I was not feeling at all well and am not) that I'll post solutions to the in-class exams
from this class by Sunday evening.  Posted now, Monday, I was feeling unwell and inefficient all weekend...<p>

Please note that I will be holding office hours at my regular times (on Zoom, not on campus) on Monday and Tuesday, and you may as usual phone me if I zone out and am not online.<p>

I'm marking homework 15 administratively (a 100 percent check for turning it in, and another 100 percent check for the message exchange).  Ill be completing message exchanges which went later [later today, probably in the evening], and you can
finish the communication with me if you enjoy it, but your message exchange check is safe if you participated.<p>

<A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/homework15sols.pdf">answer key to Homework 15</a><p>

<H3>Week Fifteen</H3>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Friday, Dec 8, 2023</B>:  Homework 15 due:  Im extending this to allow myself (and you) more time for bookkeeping with the message exchange.<p>

This day will belong to Test 3 and final review.<p>


<LI> <B>Wednesday, Dec 6, 2023:</B>  Homework 16 due;  Homework 17, due at the final, will be assigned (I wont be unwilling to answer H17 problems on Friday).<p>

This will be a day of graph theory lecture.<p>

<B>Homework 17</B>:  this is due at the final exam period.  Some, maybe most of these problems have solutions or hints, Levin's book being the way it is.  Use them intelligently;  do the problem yourself then look at the solution. You should really think of this as a set of practice problems:  I won't mark it, youll get a check for turning it in.   You are welcome to ask me questions about problems here on Friday:  4.2 exercises 1,3,9 (the hint has a typo in it, missing a word, but ought to tell you how to do this), 13, 16; 4.3 exercises 2,3,4,6; 4.4 1,3,6,14 (this is the same question as 9 in 4.2), 4.5 exercises 3,5,8.<p>




<LI> <B>Monday, Nov 27, 2023:</B> This will be a day of graph theory lecture.<p>

Please note that I have posted review materials, and I extended the Homework 15 due date, to allow more time for all of us to deal with message exchange bookkeeping.<p>

-
I hope I'll recover from the grading backlog due to my illness by the end of the week.  I also hope no one caught it!<p>

<p>

</UL>

<H3>Week Four</H3>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Friday, Sept. 15, 2023:</B> lectured on functions from set theory notes and section 0.4.<p>



<LI> <B>Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023:</B> I'll be lecturing on sets and functions, from my notes on set theory, and sections 0.3 and 0.4 in Levin.  However far I get, I will write
an assignment (to be due next Monday) and post it here by this evening.<p>  

<B>Homework 4</B>:  (posted in the morning, I was wiped out by the end of the day yesterday, still not entirely out of the woods)  <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/homework4.pdf">this handout</a>.  I'm likely to do this fairly
often because Levin provides so many solutions to the problems in his text<p>

<LI> <B>Monday, Sept. 11, 2023:</B>  I'll be lecturing on sets and functions, from preliminaries in Levin and from <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/teachingsets2023.pdf">these notes on sets and related concepts.</a><p>

Before I start that, I'm planning to do an example from your current homework.<p>

I did one of the problems in the homework (so I expect good writeups of that one from you). and I lectured roughly pp. 1-6 in the set theory notes with an excursion to pp. 11-12 where I prove that there is no universal set.<p>*-

I'm not anticipating giving an assignment today, since I am backed up on grading from being sick all weekend and your current assignment is delayed until Friday for the same reason.  I will likely give an assignment tomorrow and 
return Homework 2 Wednesday or Friday depending on how efficient I am.<p>

<p>


</UL>

<H3>Week Three</H3>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Friday, Sept. 8, 2023:</B> Lectured section 18 in the manual (which will become section 19 when I post solutions to Homework 2).  Please read section 18 carefully.<p>

Your <B>Homework 3</B> is the informal quantifier proofs in the last section of the manual (section 19 now, section 20 I think when solutions to Homework 2 are made visible).  A typo in the definition of divisibility
noticed by a student has been corrected.  I'm sorry that I posted this late:  I have been sick all day today and it slipped my mind.  Since Im posting it late, I am extending the due date to Friday the 15th.<p>



<LI> <B>Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2023:</B> Spent this period working on the computer lab.  The official due date for the computer lab is Wed Sept 20.<p>  



<p>


</UL>

<H3>Week Two</H3>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Friday, August 25, 2023:</B>  Today we will have a computer lab:  in-class time with the computer lab might or might not continue into Wednesday.<p>  

You should install the latest version of Python on your computer.  I can give guidance on this in class (and so probably can your colleagues, many of them being computer science majors), but it would be better if most people have it when we start.<p>

The software is at <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/pythonmarcel.py">this link (Python source of the Marcel theorem prover)</a><p>

Your lab instructions are at <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/M187F23marcellab1.pdf">this link (instructions for first lab)</a><p>

There is a text file with propositions to be proved in the lab conveniently set up <A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/189/M187F23marcellab1.txt">here</a><p>

<B>Please note that Homework 2 is not due until the beginning of class next Wednesday.  Also note that Monday is Labor Day, a holiday</B><p>

I'm not done marking Homework 1 yet (I expect to finish later today) but full solutions are now visible (section 17 of the manual of style).<p>



<LI> <B>Wednesday, August 23, 2023:</B> Did more examples, the last one in section 14 and the one in section 16, and started to talk about predicate logic and quantifiers.
There is suggested reading but not new homework:  read section 18 of the manual of logical style (section number changed because solutions to homework 1 are now section 17) , and also read Levin 0.2 (the last bit on predicates and quantifiers) 
and Levin 3.1 (the final bit titled Beyond Propositions).  We will continue the discussion of this material after we do our computer lab on propositional logic.<p>  



<LI> <B>Monday, August 28, 2023:</B>  Lectured section 13 in the manual of logical style.  There are examples in section 14 and also later in section 16 which might be useful.<p>
<B>Homework 2</B> is the set of four exercises on pp. 35-6 of the manual, section 15.  Please notice that if I edit the manual (which I well might this week) the page number
of the second homework set (and the first) might change, but not the section numbers.  <B>Please note that I have delayed the due date for this to Wednesday after Labor Day.</B><p>


</UL>

<H3>Week One</H3>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Friday, August 25, 2023:</B>  <p>  
Covered sections 11 and 12 in the manual of logical style.  No homework assigned.<p>




<LI> <B>Wednesday, August 23, 2023:</B> <p>   We covered notation and terminology for basic operations of propositional logic.  You can find this in the readings from Levin in the Monday entry,
and also in my notes under particular operations.  We did some sample proofs in class, which are found in the manual of logical style:  if you read the notes up to the first set of exercises,
and also read section 14, More Examples, you will see the example proofs I did, possibly with minor differences.<p>

<B>Homework 1</B> is to do the first set of exercises in the manual of logical style (in section 10, p. 18).  Also do problem 13 in section 3.1 in Levin.  I'll be happy to do problem 14 which follows it on request. These are due on Monday.<p>


<LI> <B>Monday, August 21, 2023:</B>  We talked about material covered on pp. 2-9 of my manual of logical style.  It would be a good idea to read section 0.2 (Mathematical Statements) in Levin, up to but not past
where he begins to talk about predicates and quantifiers (we will not do that for a bit), and also section 3.1 (ignoring the bit titled Beyond Propositions, which is again about quantifiers).<p>

The first homework assignment will be assigned on Wednesday or Friday.<p>
