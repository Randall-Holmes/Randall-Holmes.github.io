<H1>Math 189 section 1, Fall 2022:  Class Resource Page</H1>

Welcome to the fall 2022 first section of Math 189, Discrete Mathematics.<p>

This page provides links to resources for student in this class, including permanent resources and homework assignments, posted as they are developed (and announced here, not necessarily in class).
It will also contain announcements of events in the class (such as exams):  students should be in the habit of looking at this page regularly.<p>

<H2>Books that we will use</H2>

<A HREF="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html">Discrete Mathmetics, an open introduction, by Oscar Levin</a><p>

The entire book is available for free as an <A HREF="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/">interactive online ebook. </a><p>

You can also <A HREF="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/pdfs/dmoi-tablet.pdf">download a PDF</a>.<p>

We will also use <A HREF="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf">these lecture notes</a> by Lovasz and Vesztergombi.<p>

These are free and legal resources:  it is my second attempt to deliver a class using free online textbooks, and we will see how it goes.  I also have copies of these books
on my web page, so if there is any web interruption to their availability, we are covered.<p>

<H2>Instructor prepared notes</H2>

<A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/manualoflogicalstyle22.pdf">my manual of logical style</a>, a resource for learning formal logic and (I hope) a correct style for writing mathematical proofs.<p>

<A HREF = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/teachingsets.pdf">My new notes on sets in undergraduate discrete mathematics:</a>  I'll find out whether these work by trying them out on you.<p>
