The test grade was further slightly modified by reducing the pair of questions (7/8 being treated as a pair for this purpose though they are weighted equally)
you did worst on in weight by half.  After this adjustment, the average on the exam was 76 and the median was 78; no further adjustments seem appropriate.  Some students
did get small increments to their grades on a question or two from their takehome papers.
