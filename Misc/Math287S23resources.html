<H2>Homework assignments and other scheduled events</H2>

Please be aware that assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date.  
I am quite forgiving about late papers, but I have to leave myself the option of doing substantial problems from the homework on the date due.<p>

When you send me your homework in email, please include the name of the course (Math 287) and the name of the homework assignment (for example, Homework 1) so that I can tell where to file it without opening it.<p>

The file you send me should have a name including <B>your last name</B>, the name of the course, and the name of the assignment, for the same reasons.<p>

<H3> Week Two</H3>

<UL>

<LI><B>Thursday Jan 18:</B>   Homework 1 was due.<p>

Discussion of material on order in section 2.<p>

Homework 2:  please prove prop. 2.1 (we did this in class but I would like to see your writeup), prop. 2.7 at least two of parts ii, ii, iv (I did part i in class),
prop 2.8 (hint:  this is basically a direct application of axiom 2.1.iv to what?), prop 2.9 or prop 2.10, prop 2.11 at least two of the parts of prop 2.12.    You are allowed to justify reasoning which is entirely in terms of section 1 concepts as "algebra".  I may give some bits of this away if there are questions in class.  This is due on the 25th.<p>

Recordings of this week's lectures should be posted sometime this weekend, and instructions on how to access them will appear.<p>


<LI> <B> Tuesday Jan 16:</B>  Discussion of material in section 1 and the beginning of section 2;  no new assignment.<p>

<H3>Week One</H3>


<UL>

<LI>  <B>Thursday, Jan 12, 2023:</B>  

The language here is from the 2022 class page:  I might make changes before Thursday class.<p>

There will be an assignment to write proofs of propositions to be selected from section 1.2.  Notice that propositions are intended to be proved in the order given:  this means that when you are writing the proof of a proposition, you can use propositions which appear earlier (even if you have not proved them yet).<p>

<b>Homework 1:</b>  Please write proofs of at least three of the parts of proposition 1.11, not including (iii) which I did in class.
Please write a proof of proposition 1.14 (you may follow what I did in class, but present it cleanly);  it is an extra credit challenge to write a proof of 1.14 which is simply a chain of equations justified by the axioms;  prove proposition 1.16 (I did half of it in class), proposition 1.17, and proposition 1.18.  Prove that the divisibility relation is transitive:  if m|n and n|p then m|p (please be explicit about the use of the associative law of multiplication in this proof).

<LI>  <B>Tuesday, Jan 10, 2023:</B>  

The language here is from the 2022 class page:  I might make changes before Tuesday class.<p>

We will begin by reading sections 1.1 and 1.2 in the Art of Proof together.  Reading the partial instructions for Thursday might give you an idea of an activity which would help you...try writing proofs of some of the propositions using axioms and earlier propositions as you read.  I do suggest reading chapter 1 up to the end of section 1.2 and thinking about it before you show up for class.<p>
