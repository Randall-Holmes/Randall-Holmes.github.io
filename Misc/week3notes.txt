Heading 1 -- vector valued functions and three space curves

If we have three functions f(t), g(t), h(t) of a parameter t (functions of the usual
kind from real numbers to real numbers) we can define a new kind of function, a vector function

r(t) = <f(t),g(t),h(t)>

Many operations we can define on real-valued functions we can also
define componentwise on vector-valued functions.  For example,

lim_t->a <f(t),g(t),h(t)> is defined as

<lim_(t->a)f(t), lim_(t->a)g(t),lim_(t->a)h(t)>

do Example 2 on p. 848

The representation of space curves by vector functions is based on the
representation of any point P by the vector from the origin to P.

If f, g, h are continuous real valued functions on an interval I,
then the collection of points (f(t),g(t),h(t)) for t in I is called the space curve
traced out by r(t) = <f(t),g(t),h(t)> for t in the interval I.

Some examples are important and relatively easy to represent.

If r(t) = <a+bt,c+dt,e+ft> has components which are linear functions,
it will trace out a straight line.  We have in fact already seen this:
it is the parametric equation for a line through the point (a,c,e) parallel to
the vector <b,d,f>.

If we want to represent the segment from (a,b,c) to (d,e,f), the vector function
r(t) = (1-t)*<a,b,c> + t*<d,e,f> clearly traces out a straight line (and at a constant
rate) and equally clearly has the value <a,b,c> at t=0 and <d,e,f> at t=1,
so r(t) on t=[0,1] traces out this line segment.

Familiar plane graphs are easily parameterized:  for example we already know,
if we think about it, that r(t) = <t,t^2,0> traces out a parabola in the xy plane,
or that r(t) = <0,2*sin(3t),2*cos(3t)> traces out a circle in the yz plane.

In the plane, we know about a variety of graphs y=f(x) which can convert to parameterizations
<t,f(t)> and we know about the parameterization <cos(t),sin(t)> of the unit circle which
can be adapted to circles with other centers and radii or to ellipses.

Nontrival 3D graphs become rapidly harder to understand without visualization
software (and visualization software is NOT magic and will not always give proper
understanding of a curve).

An example we can handle is that of a helix.

The curve parameterized by x = cos(t) y = sin(t) z = t can be understood
because its behavior along the axes can be factored out.  In the xy plane it
traces out the unit circle;  in the z plane it rises steadily.  This should
give us the idea that this is a helix, a curve in the shape of a spring.

Suppose we want a spring of radius 10 which goes through four complete revolutions
as it moves up five units.

A general helix with center on the z axis is

x = a*cos(t)  y = a*sin(t) z = c*t

The radius of this helix is a, so set a = 10.

It does a complete revolution as t ranges from 0 to 2*pi:  we want the height
c*t to range from 0 to 5 as t ranges from 0 to 8*pi, so we want c = 5/(8*pi).

I believe there is a Webassign problem a little like this.

There are other geometric situations where we can deduce parameterizations.  In general,
working out and visualizing parameterizations of space curves is considerably harder
than it is in the plane.

Look at example 6, page 850.

Try insert some video here taken from Sage of the twisted cubic <t,t^2,t^3>.

We can draw some conclusions about this example -- we can get an idea of what its shadow
on the xy plane, the xz plane, and even the yz plane look like.  But the three dimensional
shape is a bit elusive...hands on experience with a CAS might help.

Heading 2:  Calculus of Vector Functions

The derivative of a vector function r(t) = <F(t),G(t),H(t)>
 is the limit as h approaches 0
of (r(t+h)-r(t))/k\h, that is the limit as h approaches 0 of
<(F(t+h)-F(t)/h,(G(t+h)-G(t))/h,(H(t+h)-H(t))/h> that is
<F'(t),G'(t),H'(t)> (recalling that limits of vector functions are defined 
componentwise).

The vector from r(t) to r(t+h) is what we might call a secant vector to the curve
at h.  (r(t+h)-r(t))/h of course points in the same direction.  As h approaches 0,
this approaches r'(t), and we see that r'(t) is a tangent vector to the curve;  in
fact, we call it *the* tangent vector to the curve.

If C = r(t_0) is a point on the curve traced out by r(t), the tangent line
at C to the curve represented by r(t) is the line through C parallel to r'(t_0), that is, 
it is the line with parametric equation L(t) = r(t_0) + r'(t_0)t

Another useful concept is the unit tangent vector:  the unit tangent vector to r(t) is
r'(t)?(||r'(t)||), the unit vector in the direction of the tangent vector.  This factors out
information about how fast the point is moving along the curve as t varies and just
tells us what direction it is going in.

Do examples 1-3 on page 857.

The differentiation formulas on p. 858 should be reviewed.

Indefinite and definite integration of vector functions is done componentwise 
as with the derivative.

Do example 5 on page 859.

Heading 3 Arc Length

To approximate the length of a curve r(t) from a to b, imagine dividing the interval from
a to b into bits of length h.  On each bit, the curve from r(t_i) to r(t_i+h) is more or less
approximated (better as h gets smaller) by the line segment from r(t_i) to r(t_i) + r'(t_i)h,
whose length is (1/h)||r'(t_i)||:  as h gets small the sum of the terms (1/h)||r'(t_i)|| is
the integral from a to b of ||r'(t)||.

We give this as the definition of the arc length of the parameterized curve.

It is conceptually useful to have this definition:  it is except in some very specific or
extremely artificially designed cases impossible to compute except numerically, because
||r'(t)|| = sqrt(f(t)^2 + g(t)^2 + h(t)^2) is usually quite impossible to integrate symbolically.

If we fix a point t=a we might compute the arc length function s(t) = int_a^t ||r'(t)|| dt
It is often conceptually useful (though usually computationally difficult) to express r(t) as
a function of s instead:  the advantage as it were is that the parameterization moves along
the curve at speed 1.

do example 1 page 862

example 2 page 863  

Please be aware that we often might want to talk about r(t) as a function of
s but presenting this symbolically is usually perfectly impossible because of the difficulty
of symbolic computation of the integrals involved.

do problem 5 on page 868.

Heading 4  Motion in Space:  Velocity and Acceleration

We know from first year calculus that the derivative has an interpretation as the slope
of the tangent line of a curve, and we have seen the generalization of that, with the derivative
understood as a tangent vector.

Suppose the position of a particle at time t is given by r(t).

Then as we go from time t to time t+h, the particle is displaced by
the vector r(t+h)-r(t) from its original position, and (r(t+h)-r(t)/h (the
directed distance covered divided by the time) is an estimate of its velocity;
as h -> 0 this approaches the exact velocity vector, and we see that v(t) = r'(t).

Basically the same argument shows that acceleration a(t) = v'(t).

A further refinement (also familiar to us from first-year calculus though
in a coarser form) is that we may not be interested in the direction of the velocity:
we define *speed* as ||v(t)||, the magnitude of the velocity, or ||r'(t)||.

Do examples 1-4 on pp. 871-2.

Your homework will give a lot of practice in computation of velocity
and acceleration functions from position functions;  you should be aware that 
position can be computed from velocity or velocity from acceleration using
integration (and a starting value).  You also need to know how to compute
position and velocity vectors at particular times (or, diabolically, perhaps
at particular points on the trajectory, for which you need to back figure the time).

Talk about the fact that if ||r'(t)|| is constant, the acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity.
This shows up easily algebraically, and it has a clear physical meaning.
