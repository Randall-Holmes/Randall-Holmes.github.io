<H1>Syllabus for Math 287 section 001, Spring 2023</H1>

<H3>The official description of the course</H3>

<B>MATH 287 - Mathematical Proofs and Methods</B><p>

An introduction to formal mathematical language, mathematical experimentation, mathematical proofs, mathematical communication, and technologies supporting the above. Core content includes sets and functions, elementary number theory and induction, and distances and topology on the real line. Additional content drawn from logic, combinatorics and probability, graph theory, and modular arithmetic.<p>

<H3>Goals of the course</H3>

This course follows Math 189:  to some extent its intent is to build on the discrete math you have learned there.  But not all content in this course will be discrete mathematics.  The primary aim of the course is not to teach specific content (though there is plenty of that in the course description) but to help you make the transition to upper division, proof-based mathematics courses.  We will work on increasing your ability to investigate mathematical questions, to prove mathematical statements true or false after investigation (or to modestly know that you may have an idea what is the case but you have not proved it) and improving your mathematical writing skills (including use of LaTeX to typeset mathematics).

<H3>Course learning outcomes</H3>

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to

<UL>

<LI>  Explore mathematical definitions and evaluate mathematical statements.

<LI>  Read and write mathematical proofs at an intermediate level.

<LI>  Possess knowlege in content areas so as to be prepared for upper-division mathematics courses.

<LI>  Use technology to support mathematical exploration and communication.

<H3>Course plan?</H3>

This is the second time I am teaching this course, and I still don't have a well-defined schedule for the course in mind.  I'm hesitant about using what actually happened the first time I taught the course as the basis for a schedule here,
both because I'm not sure I'll take the same approach, and because the fact that the course is being taught remotely may have strong effects on how it goes.<p>

<H2>Nuts and bolts</H2>

<H3>Who am I, and when and where can you find me?</H3>

I am Randall Holmes, a professor in the Math Department here since 1991.  Fortunately, the climate is too dry for ivy actually to grow on me.
My office is MB 240A, but under pandemic conditions I will hold office hours in Zoom.  I will seldom  be on campus this term.
This class meets 10:30--11:45 TTh.  My other class, MATH 311, meets 12-1:15 MW.  I tentatively schedule Zoom office hours 
for 10:30--11:30 am MWF and 3-4 pm TTh.  The same Zoom link will be used for all sessions of the class and all office hours.<p>

My email is <TT>rholmes@boisestate.edu</TT>.  My personal cell phone number is (208)509-3278 and yes, you are encouraged to call me if I haven't shown up for my Zoom office hours.  I want you to use these hours.  I may offer points for showing up with something substantial to talk about.<p>

<H3>Textbooks</H3>

All textbooks are free on the web.  Links to read or download the texts used will be found on the class resource page.<p>

<H3>Homework</H3>

Homework will be assigned typically on Thursdays (though I do not rule out Tuesday assignments) and will be due on Thursday the following week.  Homework is to be turned in electronically and will be returned electronically.  In previous semesters I have been handling this by email and initially you may assume you are turning in homework by email, and it will be returned by email.  I may bestir myself and learn to use Canvas, though.<p>

Homework assignments and other useful class resources will appear on the class resource page, which is on another tab on the site where you find this syllabus.<p>

Regular attendance at the Zoom class sessions is expected, attendance will be taken, and it will be a component of the homework grade.  I will record class sessions and make them available
but this is not a substitute for participation.<p>

<H3>Assessments</H3>

My intention at the moment is to give two hour exams and a cumulative final in this class.  My current intention is that all exams will be take-home:  if I for some reason decide to give a proctored remote exam, you will be informed.<p>

Exams will be marked in such a way that some sensible measure of central tendency (median or average) will be at 75 or above.  After whatever adjustments are required to achieve this, grading will be the usual 90=A, 80=B, 70=C etc.  The two hour exams and the homework grade will have the same weight;  the final exam grade will have twice the weight and in addition may replace the lowest of the other two grades if this helps you.  I will very seldom use +/- grades:  you may expect that your grade will be a simple A, B, C, D, F.  It will be a nine days wonder if I assign an A+ or C- to anyone;  I may use the other grades occasionally in borderline situations:  no number as such earns a +/- grade and you cannot bargain for one.<p>



<H3> The power of definition </H3>

"Tomorrow" is officially defined as the next class session, and "yesterday" as the previous class session.<p>

<H3> Be honest.</H3>

Students are expected to conduct themselves sensibly, and in particular to be honest in their academic work.  Talking to your colleagues about homework is perfectly reasonable, but what you turn in should be written by you (for your own sake!).  Please do not try to cheat on in-class exams, and please do not communicate with anyone but me about any take-home exam.  I do not want to have to think about dealing with academic dishonesty.<p>
