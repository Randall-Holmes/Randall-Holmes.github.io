Welcome to the class!  This is where homework assignmsnts and links to 
additional class resources will appear.  Get in the habit of watching 
this space!<p>

</p><h3>General information and office hours</h3>  To be added.<p>

New material will usually appear at the top.</p><p>

An online presentation of Euclid's Elements is found  <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html">here</a>. This might be useful.</p><p>

My manual of logical style is found <a  href = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/manualoflogicalstyle18.pdf">here</a>.  Initially, it is the version from 2018 that I used in the 2019 class, but I do expect to edit it so you should take a look at it whenever you are called upon to use it (I'll keep version remarks in it at the top).

</p><h2>Lecture Notes</h2>

<a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/S23M311notes.pdf">This</a>
 is a set of notes you should read regularly!  They will be updated with
 more information about definitions and axioms and more proofs of 
theorems as we go along!<p>

<H2> Turning in Homework</H2>

Please turn in homework directly to my email (<TT>rholmes@boisestate.edu</TT>).  The subject line of your email should include the name of this class (because some of you are in both classes).  The name of the file you turn in should include your last name, the name of the assignment, and the name of the class.  PDFs are preferred but I can convert other formats.<p>

<H2>Recordings of Classes</H2>

I do plan to record lectures and post them.  There will be a tab on the class page where they can be found, when there are some.  I accidentally deleted the recordings from the first week, but there should soon be recordings up (as I write this on the 19th;  I'll edit this to say that they are up and where to find them...when they are up.)<p>

<H2>Week Two</H2>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday 1/18:<p>  We started talking about logic and proof structure.  The lecture was mostly about the ways sentences are linked
and truth tables:  it will continue next Monday.  No additional homework: remember that Homework 1 is due Monday (to be turned in directly to me by email).  I would suggest reading section 2.5 in the book and the manual of logical style up to the section on implication (if..then...).<p>

My manual of logical style is found <a  href = "https://randall-holmes.github.io/Misc/manualoflogicalstyle18.pdf">here</a>.  Initially, it is the version from 2018 that I used in the 2019 class, but I do expect to edit it so you should take a look at it whenever you are called upon to use it (I'll keep version remarks in it at the top).  

Don't forget that Homework I is due next class.<p>

</UL>

<h2>Week One</h2>

<ul>

<li> Wednesday 1/11: <p> 

No additional homework today. We talked about axiomatic systmms and incidence geometry and didnt get to the group activity (looking at the schedule from 2019, I think the same thing happened then :-)<p>

</p></li><li> Monday 1/9;  <p>
This language updated on Tuesday the 10th.<p>

I'll hit the ground running with some 
exercises, though I think I will usually assign exercises on Wednesday to
 be due the following Wednesday.  These problems are due Monday after next 
(not next Monday; note that next Monday is a holiday and I'm giving an extra day before this assignment is due) and have the odd character that first assignments always 
have that you are assumed to know things which you may or may not know: 
 don't hesitate to seek help.  p. 11 problems 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (at least
 some of these statements cannot be proved, and in some cases you should
 be able to say why:  Euclid's logic does have gaps in it!), 8, 11* (11 is IMO very hard, and do not fear any damage to your grade from it).  It 
is quite possible that I will give away 11 before you have to hand in 
the assignment, but I want you to think about it (read the "proof" 
carefully and look for the mistake).<p>
