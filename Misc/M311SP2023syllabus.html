Information and Policies 
</H1>

<P>M. Randall Holmes</P>
<P><STRONG>Schedule:</STRONG></P>
<P>We meet Monday and Wednesday on Zoom
from 12 pm to 1:15 pm.</P>
<P>Dates for examinations in this class are to be announced, and I currently intend all exams to be take-home.  If I decide to give a proctored remote exam, you will be informed in a timely manner.</P>
<P><STRONG>Office and Hours:</STRONG></P>
<P>Office: Mathematics Building 240A. However, I will very seldom be there.  Office hours will be on Zoom 10:30-11:30 MW and 3-4 pm TTh.</P>

<P><STRONG>Telephone:</STRONG></P>
<P>My office telephone number is 6-3011 (208-426-3011 from off-campus).
My personal cell phone number is 208-509-3278: students are welcome to call me (in particular, to prod me if I am not in a Zoom office hour)
but please no calls after 8:30 pm any day or between 6 pm Friday and
noon Sunday.</P>
<P><STRONG>Electronic Information:</STRONG></P>
My email address is <TT>rholmes@boisestate.edu</TT>.  Homework should be turned in by email to that address.  Please make all class communications using your Boise State email.<p>

<P>I read my e-mail constantly (during the working week) and respond
promptly.</P>
<P><B>This electronic version of this syllabus is the official
syllabus (no paper copies will be made), is subject to change at my discretion, and
any changes will be posted here.</B></P>
<P>Electronic announcements for this class (and announcements to both
classes) will appear a couple of different ways.&nbsp; Announcements
tied to specific assignments and links to useful resources (other sources on geometry, old sample tests) will appear on the class announcements page; occasionally I may
send e-mail to the entire class.&nbsp; Make sure either that you read
your Boise State e-mail regularly or forward your Boise State e-mail
to an account you do read regularly.</P>
<P><STRONG>Title of Course:</STRONG></P>
<P>Math 311: Foundations of Geometry. This is section 001.</P>

<P><STRONG>Learning Goals for the Course:</STRONG></P>

Students in this course will both read and write proofs and constructions in neutral geometry, eventually specializing to Euclidean and/or Lobachevskian (hyperbolic) geometry.<p>

<P><STRONG>Textbook:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The textbook for this
class is </SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Foundations
of Geometry,</SPAN></I></STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG><STRONG><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">2</SPAN></I></STRONG><STRONG><SUP><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">nd</SPAN></I></SUP></STRONG><STRONG>
</STRONG><STRONG><I><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">ed</SPAN></I></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">,
G. Venema. We have used this book before, so you may expect to find
used copies. Ordering it from other sources does carry risks of late
arrival or getting the wrong edition, for which I will not offer much
if any support. I would use the bookstore.</SPAN></STRONG></P>
Other resources from the web may be used, to which links will be given on the class announcements page.<p>
<P><STRONG>Dates:</STRONG></P>


<P>It is very important to be aware of the add
deadline, drop deadline, and dates of tests (once I announce them). In particular, attempts
to drop after the official drop deadline may fail. If you foresee any conflicts with test dates, please
inquire as to what is possible with me in advance.</P>


<P><STRONG>Homework:</STRONG></P>
<P>Homework will be assigned from time to time (usually on Wednesday) and due one week after
it is assigned if I do not specifically say otherwise. The
assignments will appear on the class announcements page.  Homework is to be turned in to me in electronic form by email.  Please make sure that the names of files you turn in to me include the name of the course, the name of the assignment, and your last name.</P>
<P><STRONG>How Your Course Grade Will Be Computed:</STRONG></P>
<P>I expect to give two to four in-class exams this term. There will not be
formal review days for exams, except the final, though I will be
willing to take questions about exams during the usual time for
homework discussion (within reason).</P>
<P>Exams will generally be linearly scaled so that the median grade
in the class corresponds to a mid-range C (75 percent) unless I am
seriously dissatisfied with overall class performance.</P>
<P>Each exam is worth 100 points. The total homework grade will count
as an exam (100 points) [this may be modified if web-based homework
is introduced].&nbsp;&nbsp; The final counts 200 points; your
percentage grade on the final may replace the lowest of the other
four grades (in-class exams and homework) if this helps you.</P>
<P>90 or above is an A; 80 or above is a B; 70 or above is a C; 60 or
above is a D; lower grades are F (after any scaling).</P>

<p>It is useful to be aware that I do not usually use the +/- system of grading.  I will never give grades of C- or A+, and I very seldom give the other +/- grades, generally when borderline conditions exist which are not strictly related to your numerical score.  No numerical score earns a +/- grade and you will have no success negotiating one with me.<p>

<P><STRONG>Attendance:</STRONG></P>
<P>If you
do not attend this class on one of the first two days, I will
exercise my option to have you administratively withdrawn.</P>

Throughout the term, regular attendance at Zoom sessions is expected and attendance will be taken, and will be a factor in your homework grade.
Sessions will be recorded, but this is not a substitute for participation.<p>
<P><STRONG>Open Office Policy:</STRONG></P>
<P>My office hours for these classes are stated above.  I should be in my Zoom session for office hours at stated times.  If I am not, feel free to call me.
If you need help at a different time, feel free to ask on email for additional office time.</P>
<P><STRONG>Late Work and Makeups:</STRONG></P>
<P>Makeups for exams will be possible, and should if possible be
arranged in advance of your absence; you should only do this for a
good reason, and if you do this more than once I will require
official documentation of a genuine emergency. I disavow any
consistent policy about late homework papers: a late paper might go
into the pile and be graded, it might get a penalty, or you might get
the 30 percent for handing it in. You will always get at least the 30
percent.</P>
<P><STRONG>Academic Honesty:</STRONG></P>
<P>Collaboration on homework is acceptable. This does not mean
<EM>copying</EM> of homework; any paper you put your name on should
be largely your own work. Collaboration on exams is of course not
allowed. The penalty for cheating (defined as looking at another
student's paper or unauthorized use of books or notes during an exam)
will be a grade of zero (0) on the relevant exam. A repeat offense
will mean an F in the course.</P>
<p> Please be aware that I <B>will</B> do web searches for unexpectedly sophisticated language which pops up on more than one student paper, and I <B>have</B> detected dishonest use of solutions to problems in Venema found on the web.  Please do your own work.<p>

<P><STRONG>Definitions:</STRONG></P>
<P>The word ``yesterday'' is defined to mean the previous class
session; the word ``tomorrow'' is defined to mean the next class
session, unless I specifically say otherwise :-)</P>
