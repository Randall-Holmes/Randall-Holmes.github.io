\maketitle

This is due on Sunday 9/6 at 11:55 pm, the same due time as your Webassign.   There are four problems, one on each page.  One way to complete the quiz is to do it by hand on a printed copy of  the quiz, which is why I give a full page for each problem, then scan the results and return them to me.  But you can do it in other ways too.  However you do it, please show all work.
\begin{enumerate}

\item  Find real numbers $s,t$ such that $s\left<1,2\right> + t\left<3,-1\right>= \left<11,2\right>$.  Hint:  you will be solving two equations in two unknowns.

\newpage

\item  Determine the angle between the vectors $\left<1,2,1\right>$ and $\left<1,-1,3\right>$.

\newpage

\item  Find the equation of the plane through the points (1,2,3),  (3,0,1), (2,2,1).

\newpage

\item  Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection of the planes $$2x-y+z = 10$$ and $$x+2y-3z = 1.$$

\end{enumerate}
