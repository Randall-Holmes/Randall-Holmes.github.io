<h1>Easy Loglan: An Introduction for Beginners</h1>
<p class="byline">by Alex Leith (remarks added 2024 by Randall Holmes)</p>

<p>Up to now, there has only been one Loglan. Just Loglan, unqualified. 
Have you learned much Loglan? Have you actually used it? Occasionally? 
Ever? Have you ever felt at home in the language?</p>
<p>The trouble has always been that, although Loglan is in principle 
easy to learn, with its few rules (compared to any natural language) and
 its consistent grammar, it is nevertheless dauntingly hard to use. JCB 
maintained that logic and mathematics don’t come naturally to the human 
mind. It’s like trying to force a rigidly square peg into the wiggly 
shaped slots that our minds use in sampling the world. Not only that, 
but when we use Loglan we try to get it exactly right. There are no 
marks awarded for a near miss. Not so when we are learning a natural 
language. When you are starting to learn Italian or Inuit, you don’t 
worry about correct grammar, and your native hearers will generally be 
delighted that you’ve even tried. Bravo, bravo! Have a slice of walrus!</p>
<p>So perhaps we should approach Loglan in two stages. The top half of 
the mountain is Power Loglan: that’s Loglan as it is now, as it is 
described in <i>Loglan One</i>, and as it’s taught in <i>Understanding Loglan.</i></p>
<p>That’s the Loglan that tolerates no ambiguity, and in which we have 
to say exactly what we mean, because if we don’t we are likely to be 
saying something else which we didn’t mean at all. And if we are talking
 to a computer, that is how we’ll be understood. We aren’t allowed to 
rely on the intelligence, common sense and contextual knowledge of our 
hearer.</p>
<p>But what if we were to approach those fierce and icy slopes by a 
gentle stroll? Along a path through upland meadows, where we can enjoy 
the larks singing and sniff the scent of the pines? What if we were to 
abandon the strict criterion of non-ambiguity, and what if, as we do in 
natural languages, we could rely on our hearer to assume we aren’t 
saying something totally silly?</p>
<p>What if we were to start by learning Easy Loglan?</p>

<B>Holmes 2024:</B>  I am adding remarks and some minor changes reflecting things that have happened in the language since 2013.
I do not believe that anything here allows usages not found in standard Loglan:  a useful starting subset of the full toolkit of the language is described here.</P>

<h2>Easy Loglan 0: Pronunciation</h2>
<p>There is no difference in pronunciation between Easy Loglan and Power
 Loglan. Loglan pronunciation is one area which is unarguably easy. 
Apart from a few minor variants, which you’ll find are quite natural to 
your mouth, every letter is pronounced in one and only one way, and 
there are no sounds that are difficult to produce.</p>

<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  review minor changes in pronunciation in our current documents.<p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 1: The Meat of Meaning.</h2>
<p>In Loglan there are only three kinds of word.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names (like <i>Jane, Paris, Daddy</i>)  which designate 
an individual entity.</li>
  <li>Little Words (like <i>she, many, where</i> )  which glue 
meanings together.  

<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  its useful to remember that in Loglan we call these <B>cmapua</B></li>
  <li>Predicates, which provide the meat of meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll start with predicates. Loglan doesn’t distinguish between 
verbs, nouns and adjectives. A particular predicate may in one context 
be translated into English by a verbal construction, and in another 
context as a noun or an adjective. This simplifies the grammar 
enormously, and reduces the amount of vocabulary that you have to learn.</p>
<p>Because a predicate can’t be directly equated with an English 
adjective, verb or noun, we have to get into the habit very early on of 
translating a predicate into English not by a single word, but by a 
short phrase.</p>
<p>For example, the predicate <b>mrenu</b> means <i>is a man.</i> And <b>skitu</b> means <i>sits on.</i> <b>Redro</b> means <i>is redder than.</i>
 If you don’t specify what something is redder than, then you are simply
 saying that it’s red. However, if you do want to use the comparative, 
then there is nothing extra to learn.</p>
<p>The simplest Loglan utterance consists of just a predicate. <b>Mrenu!</b> or <b>Skitu!</b> I’ve added an exclamation mark because this is how we give commands in Loglan. <b>Mrenu!</b> means <i>Be a man!</i> and <b>Skitu!</b> means <i>Sit!,</i> as you might say to your dog.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Loglan commands for you to play with.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Pazda!</b>	<i>Wait!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Takna!</b>	<i>Talk!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Dargoi!</b>	<i>Go away!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ckano!</b>	<i>Be kind!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Tedji!</b>	<i>Pay attention!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Jelhaisto!</b>	<i>Be happy and healthy!</i></p>
<p class="ex">(That’s the customary Loglan way of ending a letter or email.)</p>
<p>You have probably noticed that the English translations of <b>mrenu</b> and <b>skitu</b>
 are somehow unfinished. They are not, as are the commands, complete 
utterances. The commands are a special case: in a command the predicate 
always applies to the person we are talking to. But when we use a 
predicate to make a claim, we want to say who or what it applies to. We 
want to make a statement about something that we can designate. We want 
to say <i>I am a man</i> or <i>You are sitting on the ground.</i></p>
<p>To allow us to do that, every predicate has a number of ‘slots’ 
associated with it. Some have only one slot, a few have as many as five.
 Two or three slots are common. Into these slots we can put words 
designating what the predicate applies to. These slots are often 
referred to as the ‘places’ of a predicate, and the words or expressions
 used to fill the slots, as ‘arguments’ .</p>
<p>The predicate, <b>mrenu</b> (... <i>is a man</i> ) has only one slot, indicating <em>who</em> is a man. So</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Da ga mrenu.</b> 	<i>He is a man.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ta ga mrenu.</b> 	<i>That is a man.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Djan, ga mrenu.</b> 	<i>John is a man.</i></p>
<p>So you see that we can fill the single <b>mrenu</b> slot either with a
 little word (what in English we’d call a pronoun) or a name. Actually 
there are other ways to fill the slot, ways of adapting other predicates
 so as to designate something that we could put in the <b>mrenu</b> slot.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Le ditca ga mrenu.</b> 	<i>The teacher is a man.</i></p>
<p>I’ll explain le and <b>la</b> later in Easy Loglan. That little word, <b>ga,</b> serves to separate the designator (in English terms the subject of the sentence) from the predicate. It does not mean <i>is.</i>
 It’s more like a punctuation mark, actually. We’ll see in the next 
section why it’s necessary to separate the first place designator from 
the predicate.</p>
<p>When I started learning Loglan the hardest thing to remember was to 
use ga in front of the predicate. It’s something I still forget from 
time to time. I think people will find it easier to drop the redundant <b>ga</b>’s when they come to learn Power Loglan.</p>
<p>The second predicate I introduced, <b>skitu,</b> (... <i>sits on ...</i>
 ) has two slots. If we are making a statement rather than a command, 
the first slot has to be filled. The second, and any further slots may 
or may not be filled. But if any sutori (Loglan for “second or later”) 
slot is not filled, subsequent slots are left blank too.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Da ga skitu.</b>	<i>He sits.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Da ga skitu ta.</b>	<i>He sits-on that.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Djan ga skitu le cersi.</b> 	<i>John sits-on the chair.</i></p>
<p class="continue">When we use a predicate for a command, the first slot is never filled, but the second may be.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Skitu le cersi!</b>	<i>Sit-on the chair!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Skitu la Djan!</b>	<i>Sit-on John!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Hompi mi!</b> 	<i>Drink me!</i></p>
<p>In the Loglan translation of <i>Alice in Wonderland,</i> the bottle she finds has that on the label. Actually <b>hompi</b> is a 3-slot, or 3-place predicate: ... <i>drink(s)... from....</i> So Alice’s bottle might have said <b>Hompi ba mi!</b> (<i>Drink something [from] me!)</i> or <b>Hompi ti mi!</b> <i>(Drink this [from] me!</i>) We’ll worry about such distinctions in Power Loglan, but here in Easy Loglan <b>Hompi mi!</b> is just fine; we all understand that one drinks what is in a bottle, not the bottle itself, or the label.</p>
<p>Using the predicate places in Loglan is one of the things that people
 find difficult about the language. And it is indeed difficult to 
remember, for every predicate that one knows, what each place is used 
for. Later in Easy Loglan, I’ll show you a way to get around the place 
structure. But predicates and their places are such a fundamental 
feature of Loglan that I felt we should learn to appreciate it early on.
 It is probably the most elegant and beautiful feature of Loglan. In 
Easy Loglan, if we get the place structure wrong, our hearer will surely
 be able to work out what we mean.</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 2: What Kind of Thing?</h2>
<p> In the last section we had</p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Djan, ga skitu le cersi.</b> 	<i>John sits-on the chair.</i></p>
<p>What kind of a chair is it?</p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Djan, ga skitu le groda cersi.</b> 	<i>... the big chair</i></p>
<p class="chairIndent"><b>kofcko</b>	<i>... the comfy chair</i></p>
<p class="chairIndent"><b>hardu</b>	<i>... the hard chair</i></p>
<p class="chairIndent"><b>laldo</b>		<i>... the old chair</i></p>
<p class="chairIndent"><b>mi</b>		<i>... the me chair (my chair)</i></p>
<p class="chairIndent"><b>la Djan,</b>	... <i>the John chair (John's)</i></p>

<p>The last two examples are one way that we handle possessives in Loglan. <b>Mi</b> means <i>I, me,</i> but as a qualifier it means <i>my.</i> So you see, we can use a Name or an appropriate Little Word to signal possession.</p>
<p>The point of all these examples is that, as well as some Little 
Words, and Names, we can use predicates as qualifiers. In a string of 
qualifiers, the leftmost one qualifies those to its right. This is like 
the Adjective-Noun order of English.</p>
<p><b>Ti ga mutce kofcko cersi.</b> <i>(This is-a-very comfy chair</i>) shows how each qualifier qualifies the predicate to its right, and that combined qualifier then qualifies the next one.</p>
<p>There’s a famous example in Power Loglan, <i>It’s a pretty little girls’ school,</i>
 which has at least 17 possible meanings. A school for pretty 
little-girls, or a pretty school, or a rather small school for girls....</p>
<p>The main point here is that the predicate on the left (or in some 
cases the Little Word) qualifies the word to its right, and that 
combined meaning qualifies the next predicate in the string.</p>
<p><b>Da ga mutce kukra sucmi ficlu titci.</b></p>
<p><i>He/she/it/they [is a] very-fast-swimming-fish eater:</i> i.e.: Da 
is an eater of fishes that swim very fast. If you’re having trouble, 
look at it this way: Da is-an-eater. (We’ve jumped ahead to the end of 
the predicate string.) What characterizes da’s eating? Fish. What sort 
of fish? Swimming fish. Fish that swim how? Fast swimming fish. Fish 
whose fast-swimming-speed is how? Very. That’s looking at it backwards, 
but you will soon get used to this left-to-right linking. After all, 
it’s what we do in English, (He eats very fast swimming fish) only not 
alway so consistently. Again, in Easy Loglan if you stray from the 
strict order, people will still understand: surely you’re not talking 
about fast-swimming things that are very-fish-like. If you are, you’ll 
have to explain, as you would in English. I bet the Loglan explanation 
will be simpler than the English one !</p>
<p>There is a way to change the grouping. If you wish, for instance, to say <i>Da is a very-fast-swimming fish-eater,</i> i.e. a fish-eater who swims very fast. This is done by using the little word <b>ci,</b> which acts as a kind of hyphen, giving <b>Da ga mutce kukra sucmi ficlu ci titci. Ci</b> ties the two predicates that it occurs between into a single unit (fish-eater), and <b>mutce kukra sucmi</b> qualifies that.</p>
<p>Each section of an Easy Loglan tutorial will present the vocabulary used in that section.</p>

<p class="ex"><b>groda</b> 	(<i>... is bigger than ... by... (amount)</i>)</p> 
<p class="ex"><b>hardu</b> 	(<i>... is harder, more resistant to scratching than...</i>)</p> 
<p class="ex"><b>kofcko</b> 	(<i>... happens to make comfortable ... in/about/with...</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>laldo</b> 	(<i>... is older than ... by... (amount)</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>mutce</b> 	(<i>... is more extreme than... in quality...</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>kukra</b> 	(<i>... is faster than... by (amount)... in motion...</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>sucmi</b> 	(<i>... swim(s) to ...from ... via ...</i> )</p>
<p class="ex"><b>ficlu</b>  	(<i>... is a fish</i>) </p>
<p class="ex"><b>titci</b>  	(<i>... eats...</i>)</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 3: Times and Places</h2>
<p>It’s time to get to grips with those Little Words. In sections 1 and 2 you’v e encountered some of them:</p>
<p class="ex"><b>da</b> 	<i>he</i> or <i>she</i> or <i>it</i> or <i>they</i> or <i>him</i> or <i>her</i> or <i>them.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>ta</b> 	<i>that</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>ti</b> 	<i>this</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>mi</b> 	<i>I, me, my...</i></p>
<p>The slots of predicates are filled by designations, words that identify what the predicate applies to.</p>
<p>To put a Name into a designator slot, <b>la</b> is used. Without the <b>la,</b> a Name is a call, rather like a command. <b>Djan!</b> means <i>John!</i> But logli usually say <b>Hoi Djan!</b> <i>(Oh John!</i>) which makes it quite clear we are calling him. <b>La Djan</b> designates John, for use in a predicate slot. German speakers will feel quite at home with this usage.</p>
<p>So <b>Djan, skitu!</b> means <i>John, sit!</i> whereas <b>La Djan, ga skitu.</b> means <i>John sits.</i></p>
<p><b>Le</b> is used to make a designation out of a predicate. More on that later.</p>
<p>You’ll have noticed that <b>da</b> can be translated in any number of
 way; masculine, feminine, neuter, singular, plural. How do we keep all 
those possibilities apart? The answer is that <b>da</b> refers to the 
last person or thing that we mentioned. In Easy Loglan we shan’t use 
many of them, but if we have mentioned a number of items, we can use 
also <b>de, di, do, du</b> to refer to them individually. I don’t think Easy Loglanists are ever likely to use more than two, <b>da</b> and <b>de.</b> Your hearer can sort out which you mean—or as we’ll see later—you can use an explanatory sentence to keep things straight.</p>
<p>There’s a similar set, <b>ba, be, bo, bu</b> which mean <i>something,</i> so that we can, in the same sentence, refer to four different somethings. The <b>da</b> series refers to things we can identify, and the <b>ba</b> series to things we as yet can’t. Again, we shan’t need them all. Easy Loglanists will probably use only <b>ba</b> and <b>be.</b> You should just note that <b>bi</b> which exists in Power Loglan has a quite different function. For now, just remember <b>ba</b> and <b>be.</b> <i>Something,</i> and <i>something else.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ti</b> is <i>this.</i> <b>Ta</b> is <i>that.</i> Designating something that is relatively near to you, or farther away.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ti ga mrenu.</b> 	This is-a-man.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ta ga fumna.</b> 	That is-a-woman.</p>
<p>Loglan uses the same vowels in the words for <i>here</i> and <i>there.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><i>Here</i> is <b>vi.</b></p>
<p class="ex"><i>There</i> is <b>va</b></p>
<p class="noindent">so you see, it’s like <b>ti</b> and <b>ta.</b> This series has an additional member:</p>
<p class="ex"><i>Yonder</i> is <b>vu.</b>  (ie: a long way away.)</p>
<p>More exactly, <b>vi</b> means in the same <i>place as.</i> So it serves also as a translation of <i>in, on, at.</i> Similarly <b>va</b> means <i>in a place not far from.</i> And <b>vu</b> means <i>in a place distant from.</i> So <b>vi, va, vu</b> can also play a prepositional role. <b>Vi le cersi</b> <i>on/at the chair.</i> <b>Va le cersi</b> <i>somewhere near the chair.</i> <b>Vu le cersi</b> <i>somewhere far from the chair.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><i>I, me</i>		<b>mi</b></p>
<p class="ex"><i>you</i>		<b>tu</b> (singular or plural, it doesn’t matter.)</p>
<p class="ex"><i>she, he, it</i> 	<b>da, de,.</b> <b>..</b></p>
<p class="ex"><i>we, us</i>  	<b>mu</b></p>
<p class="ex"><i>they—,them</i> 	<b>da, de,...</b></p>
<p>You notice that Loglan makes no distinction between singular and 
plural. In the ordinary course of events we don’t need to: you know what
 I’m talking about. In special circumstances we can make the 
distinction, using the number words and the vague numbers. We’ll look at
 that in the next section.</p>
<p>I think you’ll agree that Loglan has a pretty simple way of expressing statements about space.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Vi le cersi.</b> 	<i>In, on, at, the chair. Close to it.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Va le cersi.</b> 	<i>Away from the chair. Maybe in the same room.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Vu le cersi.</b> 	<i>Far from the chair. In the next street, Japan, or Alpha Centauri.</i></p>
<p>Statements about time are equally simple.</p>
<p>That word <b>ga,</b> which I emphasized, does not mean <i>is,</i> has a couple of siblings. Three in fact, and like <b>vi, va, vu,</b> they can serve either an adverbial or a prepositional role. Here they are as adverbs,</p>
<p class="ex"><b>pa</b>	<i>earlier</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>na</b>	<i>now</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>fa</b>	<i>later</i></p>
<p>These are how we make explicit past, present and future statements. <b>Ga</b> is neutral as to tense: we use it to make general statements. <b>La Djan, ga hompi,</b> <i>John drinks,</i> as opposed to <b>La Djan, na hompi,</b> <i>John is drinking now.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Djan, pa skitu le kofcko cersi.</b> <i>John earlier sat on the comfy chair.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Mi fa skitu letu cersi.</b> <i>I later (=will) sit-on your [the-you] chair.</i></p>
<p>That’s an easy set to remember:</p>
<p class="ex"><b>pa</b> 	<i>past, previously, did</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>fa</b> 	<i>future, later, will</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>na</b> 	<i>now, present, is</i></p>
<p>These time particles, like <b>vi, va,</b> and <b>vu,</b> can be used in a prepositional role: <b>Pa le hapvei</b> <i>before the party.</i> <b>Na le hapvei</b> <i>at the same time as the party.</i> <b>Fa le hapvei</b> <i>after the party.</i></p>
<p>Note that, gramatically, <b>pa, na,</b> and <b>fa</b> do exactly the same job as <b>ga</b> did. They come between the designator (“subject”) and the predicate (“verb”). But whereas <b>ga</b> is simply a separator, <b>pa, na,</b> and <b>fa</b> also give a time indication to the predicate. In fact, <b>vi, va,</b> and <b>vu,</b> can also be used in this way. When you use one of these time or space particles (and others we shall meet later) the <b>ga</b> is omitted.</p>
<p>So why do we need <b>ga,</b> which doesn’t seem to do anything?</p>
<p>Think back to what we were saying about qualifiers. Look at the sentence <b>Le laldo ditca ga klimao le cirpai.</b> <i>(The old teacher explains the lesson.)</i></p>
<p>If we wrote <b>Le laldo ditca klimao le cirpai.</b> what we’d be saying is <i>The old-teacherly explanation</i> and we don’t actually have a predicate there to make sense of the sentence, so <i>the lesson</i> is sort of hanging in a void. That wouldn’t parse.</p>
<p>In <b>Le laldo ditca ga klimao</b>..., the <b>ga</b> closes the predicate string that we’ve used to designate what’s in the first place of <b>klimao,</b> so we know that the predicate that follows, in this case <b>klimao,</b> is the main predicate of the sentence.</p>
<p>Here are some examples using time and space particles (and a couple of other useful ones) instead of <b>ga-</b></p>

<!-- good place for an example table -->
<p class="ex"><b>Mi vi skitu.</b>		<i>I here sit.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Le mrenu va pazda.</b> 	<i>The man there waits.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ti kou kofcko.</b> 		<i>This for-some-cause is-comfortable.</i><br>(i.e.: There a reason that it’s comfy. Perhaps it’s filled with goose down.)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ba vu denro mi.</b> 	<i>Something over-yonder is-dangerous-to me.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Da duo skitu.</b> 		<i>He/she/it/they by-some-method sits.</i></p>
<p class="ex">(Perhaps it’s a medieval knight in armour, and can only sit by using a crane.)</p>

<p>These little words can also qualify the predicate in a sentence, or 
they can qualify one of the designators that fill the predicate’s 
places. They behave very like English adverbs and prepositions. We’ll 
meet more of them later.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Da duo ne mekleo ridle.</b> 	<i>He by-means-of one pair-of-spectacles reads.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Mu skitu vi le kruma.</b> 	<i>We sit in the room.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Mi pa brana vu la Loglandias.</b> <i>I</i>  <i>was born a long way from Loglandia.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Levi cersi ga kofcko.</b> 	<i>This (the-here) chair is-com</i> <i>fy.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Lepa denro na</b> <b>fiacko tu.</b> 	<i>The-past dangerous-thing now scares you.</i></p>
<p>Note that it’s customary to write le with <b>pa/na/fa/vi/etc/mi</b>/etc as one word.</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 4: How many are there?</h2>
<p>The numbers are something that one needs to learn very early on in 
one’s study of any language. Fortunately the Loglan numbers are 
extremely easy to remember.</p>

<p>For the compound numbers we speak the digits in sequence, and we write them as one word. So <i>ten</i> is <b>neni</b> (one-zero) and <i>eleven</i> is <b>nene</b> (<i>one-one</i>). In the same way, <i>twenty three</i> is <b>tote.</b></p>
<p>When we get to the bigger numbers we use the suffixes <b>-ma</b> <i>hundred</i> and <b>-moa</b> <i>thousand,</i> [<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  <B>moa</B> not <B>mo</B> in post 2013 Loglan] so <i>one hundred</i> is <b>nema,</b> and <i>two thousand</i> is <b>tomoa.</b> Bigger units are made by aggregation: <i>five million</i> is <b>femoamoa. Nemoa sia.</b> <i>A thousand thanks.</i></p>
<p>There is no indefinite article in Loglan, so we use <i>one.</i> <b>Ne mrenu</b> actually means <i>precisely one man,</i> but that’s near enough what you need, if you want to say <i>A man went.</i> <b>Ne mrenu pa godzi.</b> If you wanted to be more vague you could say <b>Ba pa godzi.</b> <i>Someone/thing went.</i></p>
<p>
<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  I don't quite get this.  There are indefinite articles in Loglan, and <B>Su mrenu pa godzi</B> is quite precisely "a man went"  (at least one man went).<p>
<p>
<p>The numbers are precise.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ne mrenu pa godzi.</b> 	<i>Exactly one man went.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Fe ditca ga hijra,</b> 	<i>Exactly five teachers are here.</i></p>
<p>There are, too, a set of “vague quantities”, translating <i>all, many, enough, a few/little, at least, about,</i> etc. These are the <b>r-</b> and <b>s-</b> sets. </p>

<table class="raTable">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><b>ra</b> <i>all</i></td> <td><b>sa</b> <i>almost, approximately</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>re</b> <i>most, more than half</i></td> <td><b>(se</b> <i>six</i>)</td>
	</tr>

<p class="continue">So <b>sanema</b> means <i>about a hundred,</i> and <b>sineni</b> means <i>not more than ten.</i></p>
<p>As well as the <b>r-</b> and <b>s-</b> sets, there are a couple of suffixes that are used with numbers.</p>
<p><b>-ri</b> forms ordinals. <b>Le neri bukcu,</b> <i>the first book.</i></p>
<p><b>-ro</b> is used for a comparative series. This is especially important as the way that Loglan forms superlatives. <b>Le nero gudbi kruma,</b> <i>the best room.</i> <b>Le raro kukra sucmi ficlu,</b> <i>the least (“allth" i.e. last in comparative order) quickly swimming fish, the slowest fish.</i></p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 5: That’s what I mean.</h2>
<p><b>Le cersi,</b> as we’ve seen in unit 3, means the chair. <b>Le</b> with a predicate makes a designation out of it. It works just the same with a string of predicates: <b>le kofcko cersi,</b> <i>the comfortable chair.</i></p>
<p>Similarly <b>la</b> with a name makes a designation. [Without the <b>la,</b> a bare name is a call.]  <B>Holmes 2024</B>:  a bare name cannot be used as a vocative in post-2013 Loglan.  This actually caused endless phonetic problems which the older computer parsers couldn't detect.  The vocative marker <B>hoi</B> must always be used, and I am putting it into the examples.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Hoi Djan, helba mi!</b> 		<i>John, help me !</i>  [<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  note that this was changed]</p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Djan, ga helba mi.</b> 	<i>John helps me.</i></p>
<p>It’s important to pause after you use a name. Only names end in a 
consonant. All predicates and little words end in a vowel. You pause 
after a name so that your hearer can tell it’s a name. That’s why I’ve 
put a comma in these examples. You have to write a comma after 
each name in Loglan [<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  the parser now absolutely requires this; in earlier versions it was encouraged but not mandatory]</p>
<p>Predicates always end in a vowel, and they always contain two 
adjacent consonants. There are just over a thousand “primitive” 
predicates, and these all consist of two syllables. The two consonants 
may occur at the beginning, like <b>mrenu,</b> or between the syllables, like <b>cersi.</b>
 Of course, a thousand some words is nowhere near enough to carry the 
whole meat of meaning. So most predicates are “complexes”: they are 
formed from two or more primitive predicates each of which contributes 
an abbreviated form (known as an “affix”) to the complex. <b>Kofcko</b> is a complex. It is formed from <b>komfu</b> → <b>kof</b> (... <i>is comfortable in circumstances</i> ...), and <b>ckozu</b> → <b>cko</b> (... <i>causes... under conditions ...</i> ). This is used in cases of non-intentional or non-human causation. <b>Madzo</b> → <b>mao</b> (... <i>make... out of...)</i> deals with intentional causation, so <b>kofmao</b> (... <i>make ... comfortable</i> ) is used when you are intentionally making someone comfortable, either physically or mentally. In the latter case <b>kofmao</b> could be translated as <i>comfort/console/reassure/solace.</i></p>
<p>Another common affix is <b>cenja</b> → <b>cea</b> (... <i>become/change into ... from ... ).</i> This is used in situations where no cause is specified. For example <b>morcea</b>, (... <i>die).</i> The <b>mor</b> affix comes from <b>morto</b> (... <i>is dead</i>). So <b>morcea</b> simply states the fact of something dying. We also have <b>morcko,</b> where something kills someone, but there is no intention involved. <b>Le fagro pa morcko da,</b> <i>The fire killed him.</i> <b>Mormao</b> is used in a case of intentional killing: <b>La Djan, pa mormao le ditca,</b> <i>John killed the teacher.</i></p>
<p><b>Jelhaisto,</b> which you met in section one, is made from <b>djela → jel (...</b> <i>is healthier than ... ),</i> <b>hapci → hai</b> (... <i>is happy about...</i> ), and <b>stolo</b> → <b>sto</b> (... <i>remain/stay at...</i>). So what <b>jelhaisto</b> means is (... <i>stays happy and healthy )</i> and it’s most commonly used as a command.</p>
<p>Once you know the primitive predicates, you can make an educated 
guess at the meaning of a complex that you have not encountered 
before—perhaps because the person using it has just made it up! This is 
one of the joys of Loglan: although the dictionary now contains some ten
 thousand words, we are always coming across ideas that require a new 
word. Finding an original metaphor that fits the idea perfectly is a 
very satisfying achievement. In time the language is likely to be richer
 in vocabulary than any natural language, as logli make finer and finer 
distinctions to express the subtleties of thought.</p>
<p>Little words also end in a vowel. They never contain more than one 
consonant in succession. The forms that little word syllables can take are limited to v, vv, cv 
and cvv, where v stands for “vowel” and c for “consonant”. When two or 
more little words are used together, we usually give each of them a neutral 
stress [<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  stresses in little words were always allowed but optional:  there is a special rule that you must pause after a finally stressed little word before a predicate;  none of this is new]. For instance <b>lemi,</b> <i>my</i> ..., <b>letu,</b> <i>your</i>..., <b>lena,</b> <i>the present... .</i></p>
<p><b>Le</b> can be used with many little words. For instance, the number words. <b>Le to mrenu</b> means <i>the two men.</i> And <b>To le mrenu</b> means <i>two of the men.</i> <b>To le neni mrenu</b> means <i>two of the ten men.</i> That’s pretty straightforward. Practise your numbers in these expressions, using different predicates: <b>cersi, ditca, cirpai, fumna</b> (... <i>is a woman</i> ), <b>tobme</b> (... <i>is a table</i> ), <b>hompi</b> (... <i>drink... from ...).</i></p>
<p>Does the idea of saying <b>Te le hompi</b> puzzle you? It needn’t. 
Any of the predicates that we normally translate as verbs can also 
signify any person or thing doing the action. So <b>le hompi</b> means <i>the drinker,</i> and <b>te le hompi</b> is <i>three of the drinkers .</i> Similarly for <b>ditca.</b> We met this word as meaning <i>teacher,</i> but its full definition is ... <i>teach/instruct subject ... to ... .</i> <b>Sucmi</b> means ... <i>swim to ... from ... via</i> ..., so <b>Ra le sucmi</b> means <i>all the swimmers.</i>
 It will seem odd for a while, but your mind will soon start to think in
 a more loglandical way, and expressions like these will seem perfectly 
natural.</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 6: Having an attitude</h2>
<p>There is a category of very useful Loglan little words which tell the hearer how the speaker feels about what da is saying. <b>(Da</b>
 is such a useful way of avoiding that clumsy “he or she” that logli 
often use it in English.) These are known as attitudinals. They do not 
affect the truth value of a claim, but express the speaker’s attitude to
 what da is saying.</p>
<p>All these attitudinals are vv in form, and the initial letter 
determines which of five families the word belongs to. The first family 
is four words beginning with <b>a-,</b> which all have something to do with the intentions of the speaker.</p>

<p><b>ai</b> intention</p>
<p class="ex"> <b>Ai mi sucmi I</b> 	<i>intend to swim.</i></p>

<p><b>ao</b> desire</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ao tu ditca l</b> <b>a Loglan, mi.</b> 	<i>I want you to teach Loglan to me.</i></p>

<p><b>ae</b> hope</p>
<p class="ex"> <b>Ae tu jelhaisto.</b> 	<i>I hope you stay well and happy.</i></p>

<p><b>au</b> don’t care</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Le tu cersi au ga kofcko.</b> 	<i>I don’t care if your chair is comfortable.</i></p>

<p>The second family consists of five words beginning with <b>u-</b>. 
They are often used alone, as a one-word utterance, although they can 
also be embedded somewhere in a sentence. These most directly express 
the speaker’s feelings. </p>

<p><b>ua</b> satisfaction.</p>
<p class="ex">Think of French <i>voila</i> <i>. Ah, there we are!</i></p>
<p><b>ue</b> surprise, </p>
<p><b>ui</b> pleasure</p>
<p><b>uo</b> annoyance</p>
<p><b>uu</b> sorrow, regret</p>
<p class="continue">These are pronounced |wa|, |weh|, |wee|, |woh|, |woo|.</p>

<p>There are four attitudinals beginning with <b>e-</b>. </p>

<p><b>ea</b>  suggestion, proposal</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ea mu godzi.</b>	<i>Let’s go.</i></p>
<p><b>eu</b> supposition</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Eu tu logli.</b> <i>Suppose you were a Loglander.</i></p>
<p><b>eo</b> please</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Eo hompi!</b> <i>Please drink!</i></p>
<p><b>ei</b> question</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ei tu logli?</b> <i>Are you a Loglander?</i></p>

<p><b>Ei</b> is used to elicit a yes/no response. There are several other interrogative little words which we’ll meet later.</p>
<p>The i-initial attitudinals deal with degrees of certainty and doubt.</p>

<p><b>ia</b>	certainty.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ia. Mi ia logli.</b> 	<i>Yes. I’m certainly a Loglander.</i></p>

<p><b>io</b>	probable</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Levi cersi io kofcko.</b> 	<i>This chair is probably comfortable.</i></p>

<p><b>ii</b>	possible</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Leva fumna ii mrenu.</b> 	<i>That woman might be a man.</i></p>

<p><b>iu</b>	unknown</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ei leva fumna ga mrenu? —Iu.</b> 	<i>Is that woman a man?</i> — <i>I</i> <i>dunno.</i></p>

<p><b>ie</b>	which?</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ie fumna ga mrenu?</b> 	<i>Which woman is a man ?</i> </p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ie le te fumna ga mrenu?</b> 	<i>Which of— the three women is a man?</i></p>

<p>The last four examples hark back to <i>Loglan One</i>, page 183, where JCB explains that <b>le</b> actually means <i>the thing that I’m thinking of which appears to be a....</i> The example he uses is of two detectives who have arrested what they had assumed was a woman. Later, one says to the other <b>Le fumna ga mrenu.</b> In other words, the detectives had thought the suspect was a woman, but closer examination revealed that da was a man.</p>
<p>In Power Loglan, this leads into some interesting logical 
considerations. In Easy Loglan we don’t need to worry about that; 
however the example reveals something about how we actually use the word
 <i>the</i> in English. Loglan can actually help us understand English better. <b>Ui!</b></p>
<p>The last family of attitudinals is o-initial, and deals with degrees of moral compulsion and permission. </p>

<p><b>oa</b> compulsion</p>
<p class="ex"> <b>Oa mi cirna la Loglan.</b> 	<i>I must learn Loglan.</i></p>
<p><b>oe</b> duty</p>
<p class="ex"> <b>Oe mi no hompi ti.</b> 	<i>I ought not to drink this.</i></p>
<p><b>oi</b> permitted</p>
<p class="ex"> <b>Ia tu oi hompi ta.</b> 	<i>Certainly you may drink that.</i></p>
<p><b>ou</b> indifference</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ou tu hompi ta.</b> 	<i>It doesn’</i> <i>t matter if you drink that.</i></p>

<!-- "Negatives" header doesn't really fit the flow of the formatting. Remove? Make an H3?-->
<h3>Negatives:</h3>

<p class="noindent">Negatives are very easy in Loglan. <b>No!</b>  by itself means <i>No!.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ei tu logli? —No.</b> 	<i>Are you a Loglanist? —No.</i></p>
<p>Embedded in a sentence, it means <i>not.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>No hompi ta!</b>	<i>Don't drink that!</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Uu mi no saadja la Loglan.</b> <i>Unfortunately I don’t understand Loglan.</i></p>
<p>(Pronounce <b>saadja</b> as /sa-AH-dja/) It is a complex formed from <b>sanpa → saa</b> <i>(...is a sign of ...to... prompting behavior... in situation</i> ...) and <b>djano → dja</b> (... <i>know that... about...).</i> So <b>saadja</b> means ... <i>understand/know the meaning of sign ... .</i>
 In a later section we’ll go through all the predicates we’ve introduced
 so far, and give you typical sentences using them, which will serve to 
fix the place structure in your mind. Furthermore, as I mentioned 
earlier, I’ll show you an easy way to rearrange the places to fit what 
you want to say.</p>
<p><b>No</b> usually qualifies the word that follows it.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Mi no pa hompi ta.</b>	<i>I didn’t drink that.</i> (Neutral.)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Mi pa no hompi ta.</b>	<i>I didn’t <em>drink</em> that.</i>  (But maybe I sniffed it.)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>No mi pa hompi ta.</b>	<i>I</i> <i>didn’t drink that.</i>  (But someone else did.)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Mi pa hompi no ta.</b>	<i>I didn’t drink <em>that</em>.</i> (But I may have drunk something else.)</p>
<p>In the special case where <b>No</b> is the first word in the sentence, followed by a brief pause, it acts as a general negation, negating the whole sentence.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>No, mi pa hompi ta.</b> <i>It is not the case that I drank that.</i></p>
<p class="continue">That’s logicians’ talk, but it makes it clear that the whole sentence is negated.</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 7: Ifs and ands.</h2>
<p>Power Loglan has an extensive set of what are called ‘Logical 
Connectives’, which is one of the areas that people often find 
difficult. Our minds are just not the right shape to absorb logical 
concepts. So here in Easy Loglan we’ll present only what fits our wiggly
 mind-holes.</p>
<p><i>And</i> is simple enough. <i>John and Mary.</i> Both together. In Loglan, <b>La Djan, e la Meris. Le ditca, e le sucmi.</b> <i>The teacher and the swimmer. He loves and respects her</i> is <b>Da cluva, e rispe de.</b> Do please notice those commas: you need to make a brief pause <em>before</em> all these connectives.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <i>or.</i> The logician’s <i>or</i> is not quite the same as our most usual English <i>or.</i> The logician’s <i>A or B</i> actually means <i>A or B or both.</i> That’s known as an inclusive <i>or,</i> whereas our normal <i>A or B</i> is usually taken to mean <i>Either A or B, but not both,</i> an exclusive or. In Easy Loglan <i>or</i> is <b>a</b>. 
<!-- make example lines? -->
<b>La Djan, a la Meris,</b> <i>John or Mary (or perhaps both).</i> <b>Da titci, a klipu le grato,</b> <i>He eats, or keeps the cake.</i></p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 8: Possessions</h2>
<p>In section 5 we met <b>lemi,</b> <i>my,</i> and <b>letu,</b> <i>your.</i>  <b>Leda</b> means <i>his/her/its/their.</i> Other possessives use the little word <b>pe.</b>  If you speak French, Italian or Spanish this way of expressing possession will be quite familiar.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Tu na skitu le cersi pe le ditca.</b> <br><i>You are sitting-on the chair of the teacher.</i></p>
<p class="continue">The word <b>pe</b> actually indicates any kind of connection, not just possession. For instance, <b>Le kapta pe le grobou,</b> <i>the captain of the ship.</i></p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 9: Who are you?</h2>
<p>As we saw in section 6, <b>ei</b> makes a sentence into a question. The kind of question that <b>ei</b> makes requires a Yes/No answer.</p>
<p>What if we want an answer that gives us more information than that? 
Who are you? What’s this? What’s it like? How many are there?</p>
<p>In these cases we use the little words <b>hu, he, ho</b> and <b>ie.</b></p>
<p>Which you use depends on the kind of answer you are expecting. When the answer is going to be a designator, we use <b>hu.</b></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Hu fa godzi? —La Djan.</b> 	<i>Who will go?</i> <b>—</b><i>John.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Hu ga namci tu? —Liu Djan, ga namci mi.</b> <br><i>What names you? (What is your name?)</i> —<i>The-word “John" names me. (My name is John.)</i></p>
<p>Note the little word <b>liu.</b> This, like <b>la</b> and <b>le,</b> 
is a word that forms a designation. In this case it is like putting a 
single word in quotes, as we do when we are talking about the word, 
rather than using it. Power Loglan has several other kinds of 
designator. In Easy Loglan we shan’t need them, but it’s comforting to 
know that they all begin with the letter <b>l</b>.</p>
<p>When the answer is going to be a predicate, we use <b>he.</b></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ti ga he? —Ti ga cersi.</b> 	<i>This is what? —This is a chair.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ti ga he cersi? —Ti ga kofcko cersi.</b> <br><i>This is what-kind-of chair?</i> <i>—This is-a comfortable chair.</i></p>
<p>When the answer is going to be a number, we use <b>ho.</b></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ho le mrenu pa kamla?</b> —<b>Fo.</b> <br><i>How-many-of the men came?</i> —<i>Four.</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>Hoba tugle ne mrenu?</b> —<b>Toba.</b> <br><i>How-many-somethings be-leg one man? —Two-somethings.</i></p>
<p>The last example is very loglandical. <b>Tugle</b> is a predicate meaning... <i>is a leg of... .</i> So <b>Toba tugle ne mrenu.</b> means <i>Two somethings are-a-leg-ofone man. (One man has two legs.)</i></p>
<p>When the answer is going to pick one of a range of possibilities, we use <b>ie</b>.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>Ie le cersi ga kofcko? —Le groda.</b><br><i>Which of the chairs is comfy?</i> — <i>The big one.</i></p>
<p><b>Hu</b>  allows us to ask when? where? how? why?</p>
<p class="ex"><b>na hu?</b> 	when? (<i>at the same time as what?</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>vi hu?</b> 	where? <i>(in the same place as what?</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>duo hu?</b> 	how? <i>(by doing what?)</i> </p>
<p class="ex"><b>kou hu?</b> 	why? (<i>caused by what?</i>)</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan 10: Tagging the places</h2>
<p>Sentences about giving somebody something are tricky in English. We usually understand because <i>Daddy gave Jane a puppy</i> makes sense if the gift was a puppy and the recipient was Jane. But consider <i>Where did you get it?</i> <i>—Daddy gave it me.</i> Here the gift and the recipient are in reverse order compared to the first sentence. We still know which makes sense.</p>
<p>In Loglan the place structure of <b>donsu</b> is (... <i>give gift</i>... <i>to recipient...</i>
 ). But I have to admit that because of the English tendency to reverse 
the order of the second and third places, logli often have difficulty 
remembering the canonical structure. There are a number of other actions
 that involve a similar structure: sending, offering, bringing, etc.</p>
<p>If we come up against a situation where we can’t remember the 
structure and we need to make sure we are correctly understood, there 
are several little words (called Case Tags) that we can use.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>La Far, pa donsu beu ne kangi dio la Djein.</b> <br><i>Daddy gave a puppy to Jane.</i></p>
<p>But with <b>beu</b> and <b>dio</b>  we can change the order:</p> 
<p class="ex"><b>La Far, pa donsu dio la Djein, beu ne kangi.</b><br><i>Daddy gave to Jane a puppy.</i></p>

<p class="continue"><b>beu</b> indicates something which passively undergoes some process. Here it’s the gift, </p>
<p class="continue"><b>dio</b>  indicates a destination or receiver. (Think of the word ‘direction’)</p>
<p class="continue"><b>sau</b> indicates a source, reason or cause.</p>
<p>Notice the predicate <b>kangi</b> (... <i>is a puppy ).</i> As a 
general rule, no two predicates are distinguished only by the final 
vowel. However there are two exceptions to this rule, the so-called 
animal and national declensions.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>kangu</b> 	(... <i>is a dog)</i> This is the most general term.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>kango</b> 	(... <i>is a male dog)</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>kanga</b> 	(... <i>is a female dog</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>kangi</b> 	(... <i>is a puppy/infant dog</i>)</p>
<p class="ex"><b>kange</b> 	(... <i>is more canine/dog-like than ...</i>)</p>
<p>As well as the predicates for specific animals, <b>katmu, hormu, kasnu</b> <i>(cat, horse, cow)</i> these endings are applied also to <b>humnu</b> (... <i>is a human being),</i> <b>ficlu</b> (... <i>is a fish)</i> and <b>nirdu</b> (... <i>is a bird)</i></p>
<p>The national declension gives a similar set of related meanings to all the predicates expressing nationality.</p>
<p class="ex"><b>logli</b> 	(... <i>is a Loglandian</i> <i> person, a Loglander)</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>logla</b> 	(... <i>is an element/feature/expression of the Loglan language)</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>loglo</b> 	(... <i>is an element/feature/expression of Loglandian culture)</i></p>
<p class="ex"><b>logle</b> 	(... <i>is a Loglandian place/territory, a region inhabited by Loglanders)</i></p>
<p>The same endings are applied to all the other nationality words, such as <b>merki</b> <i>(American),</i> <b>gleci</b> <i>(English),</i> <b>frasi</b> <i>(French),</i> <b>ruski</b> <i>(Russian),</i> <b>spani</b> <i>(Spanish),</i> <b>talni</b> <i>(Italian),</i> etc.</p>

<h2>Easy Loglan: 11 ... More to Come ...</h2>
<p>Much of the difficulty of Power Loglan arises because the language 
covers all the options. Easy Loglan removes most of these options. The 
tutorial and practice material of Easy Loglan will school the learner to
 use short, simple sentences. Consequently <b>da</b> will have fewer decisions to make than has <b>da</b>’s colleague <b>de</b>,
 who is learning Power Loglan from scratch. One learns a language by 
using it, by actually producing utterances. With fewer decisions, <b>da</b> will be able more rapidly to produce Loglan utterances, and should consequently learn faster, much faster than <b>de</b>, who will be spending most of <b>de</b>’s
 time working out which construction to use or how to terminate a 
clause. A fascinating intellectual challenge, but not a way to become 
fluent. With fluency one becomes able to use the new language directly, 
rather than by translating from one’s home language.</p>
<p>In time, I hope we shall have a progressive and integrated Loglan 
course, first introducing Easy Loglan, with ample reading and practice 
materials. Then bit by bit presenting the features of Power Loglan which
 Easy Loglan lacks: the student should thus greet each new addition with
 a feeling of “Aha, that’s jolly useful. Now I see how to say something 
more clearly and elegantly.” Thus da incorporates the new feature into 
da’s background of fluency, not seeing it as a difficulty but as an 
extension of the scope of what da is able to express.</p>
<p>Please discuss Easy Loglan and let us know your thoughts. When we arrive at a stable description I’ll devote an entire issue of <i>La Logli</i> to reading and practice materials in Easy Loglan.</p>

<B>Holmes 2024</B>:  final remarks -- I really don't think this allows anything which is forbidden in standard Loglan.  It's a useful introductory subset of the language.  Please note where I have made minor changes.  The most important one that was necessary is that one <B>cannot</B> use a bare name as a vocative (a call):  one has to use the vocative particle <B>hoi</B>, which was already present in Loglan before 2013.  There are profound phonetic reasons (part of Power Loglan, not Easy Loglan) why this change had to be made<p>

I also think there are some significant things missing here which should be in Easy Loglan:  the use of letters as pronouns is more easy and natural than the use of the
<B>da</B> series.  I have not checked vocabulary;  there might have been changes in the meanings of some of the words used.  Do also notice that the suffix for a thousand is <B>moa</b> not <B>mo</B>;  the latter syllable had too many other uses.<p>
