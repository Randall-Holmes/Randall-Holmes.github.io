Lo dinhosauri pa specymorcea kou hu?


# The dinosaurs went extinct, how?

Ikou, da pa norkancea lopo cluva.


# because they became unable to love

# note the need for the comma after <ikou>

I da pa cikpoa lepo damfio titci,\
I da pa cikpoa lepo zavmao lepo da dzabi.


# and they were depressedly eating each other

# and they were making each other's existences bad

Da pa rojmao lo muegro dante,\
I da pa rojmao lo groda rirgu.


# they grew enormous teeth, and they grew big bottoms

# note the need in some places for backslashes to continue a line.

Da pa damfio cangoi lo gratrigru.


# They were depressedly roaming the mass of all great forests

# (the effect of <lo gratrigru> should be extreme)

I pa no lopo perkri, I pa no lopo spopa, I pa no lopo rarclu.


# I dont think this means what is intended:  "not before faith, not before hope, not before charity"

# is what is said.  Perhaps, "I da pa no perkri, i da pa no spopa, i da pa no rarclu"

Coa lo dinhosauri pa specymorcea.


# Thus (in summary), the dinosaurs became extinct

Lo mamhutui pa specymorcea kou hu?


# The mammoths became extinct, how?

Ikou, de pa norkancea lopo cluva.


# because they became unable to love

I de damfio titci lo grasa.


# and they depressedly ate grass

I de no pa zavmao lepo ba dzabi.


# and they did not make any being's existence worse

## I note that I have not checked correctness of the use of the da/de 

# pronoun system

Lo humnu pa krani de lo jughou.


# Humans drove them into pit traps

Ibuo uu de fablei lopo pridioblo hei.


# I cannot find <feblei>  -- it is <fablei>

# I guess,  Regrettably, they (mammoths) resigned themselves to note strike back at them (humans)

# note that the speaker regrets this:  <uu> does not imply sadness on the part of the mammoths.

I de pa nu sitfa lo jughou, e dazpozfa lopo cankrirai \
# and they were in the pit traps and stubbornly tried to find their way out (?)

# <cankrirai> is a neologism

Lopo specymorcea conoi no specymorcea.


# No, they stubbornly tried to guess whether they would become extinct or not.  But this doesn't necessarily succeed in saying what is intended.

# I suggest <Lezo de specymorcea> instead.  But this doesn't replicate the rhetorical structure of the original,
# which is common in natural languages and doesn't translate well into Loglan.

Coa sui lo mamhutui pa specymorcea.


# thus (in summary) the mammoths became extinct.

Buo lo humni napa specymorcea kou hu?

# But how have the humans become extinct?


Ikou, di napa norkancea lopo cluva.

# because they have become unable to love  (comma added for the parser)


I di napa nordri lepo li No, raba \


Nurvea lu ga normuotra.

#and they forgot that "Not everything is for sale" is an eternal truth


Di napa resduo lo retca resfu.

# they have dressed in different clothes


I rei ga draka lo natli go mucdraka.

# and they (the clothes) were darker than the darkest night


I mi na driki le sitfa \

# and I remember the place


jio pa me le telfoa pe lo humni

# which was called the earth of humanity


Hoi menfremi! Hoi fumfremi! Tuo na sacgoi hu?

# Men!  Women!  Where are you going?


Muo cnida lopo cluva. I lie All-You-Need-Is-Love.

# We all need love.  "All you need is love".


Hoi lo humni, cikpoa lopo cluva!

# Humans, love one another!


I driklipu lepo toi normuotra.

# and remember that this is an eternal truth
