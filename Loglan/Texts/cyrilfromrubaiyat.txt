#Translation from Omar Khayyam (though I took a liberty to mix-and-match several original rubai into one)

hu pa kambei mu ti, rau hoba, \
e fa gozbei mu hu, rau noba? \
i ga lilfa lo vinjo, ibuo \
hompi vei! i tu sadji ia duo

# Randall translates

# who has brought us to this for how many reasons

# and will carry us where, for no reason

# wine is outlawed, but

# drink it.  You are thus wise!

#and if you want to listen it in czechologlandia mode, here is alternate "czech" spelling:

#hu pa kambei mu ti, rau hoba,
#e fa gozbei mu hu, rau noba?
#i ga lilfa lo vinžo, ibuo
#hompi vei! i tu sadži ja duo

hupakam'beimuti, ra'uho*ba, \
efagoz'beimuhu, ra'uno*ba? \
igalil'falovin'jo, ibuo', \
hom*pivei! itusad'ji, iaduo'

# there is a perhaps deliberate hiccup in the meter? at hompi...there is a serious metric problem because rau is a disyllable.

# An advantage of my more phonetically fluent parser is that we can analyze meter in it!

# a subtle point is that the pause after sadji *must* be expressed in a phonetic parse:  one must pause before ia

# also one must pause after ibuo if (as I assume from the meter) it is finally stressed...which works well
# since an unexpected full stress follows it -- in fact, I made the stress on hompi emphatic

#  Cyril's stress

hupakam'beimuti', ra'uho'ba, \

igalil'falovin'jo, ibu'o, \
