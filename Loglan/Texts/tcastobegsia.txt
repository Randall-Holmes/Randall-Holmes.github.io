#Translation by Randall Holmes of a recent #loglan-only post by la Bekli


nao, na le nerpasdei, mi jmite su mutce treci pernu.  I tao cmalo nornoa, i buo ...


#Now, yesterday, I met a very interesting person (some very interesting people?)  And this is a small average, but...  [I am not quite understanding <cmalo nornoa>


na le nerpasnai, mi pa tcidaa, ebuo, no danza go kokfa su tcidi. i buo, pa mutce natli, icenurau, re le resra je vi la Sotyvla, Sitci no ga vedma.


#Last night, I was hungry, but did not want to cook any food.  But, after much of the night [midnight>], more than half of the restaurants in Salt Lake City were not open.


inumoi, mi pa disri lepo getsi su tcidi pe la Takobel, ja vedma na supo mutce natli, rea. 


#Thus, I decided to get food at Taco Bell, which is open at some late hours of the night, certainly [am I understanding this correctly?]


i ceu, na lepo mi hijra le tcastobegsia, mi vizka ne pernu ji stali vi le zvorua je tei, e clina bleka mi. i pei cmalo pernu, e respli su cao cao nornoa. 


i mi piazi jupni lepo pei verba, e trati go duvri beu lepei penre.


#And anyway, while I was at the drive-up window (my guess at <tcastobegsia>), I saw one person who stood at the exit [from the drive-through] and looked straight at me.


#They were a small person and dressed very oddly. And I was believing that they were a child and trying to find their parents.


i buo, na lepo mi darca le zvorua guo, mi duvri lepo pei vrecoa fumna, enoi verba.


#[Lojban <darca>, standard Loglan would be <fadgoi>]


#But after I arrived at the exit, I discovered that they were a short woman, not a child


i pei respli ne nornurdua curta, e su kapcutci ji simci loe kapcutci ji nu respli loe prenyspe, ueue. 


i pei cutse dio mi suba ji no nu hirti kou le gliso gui, efa, sanduo lepo mi fui kapmao le tcaro cundo. 


#They wore an unadorned shirt, and sandals that seemed to be the typical sandals worn by convicts (?), surprisingly.


#And they said something to me which I couldn't hear through the glass, and then signalled that I should open the car window.


i mi piazi pazda, efabuo, kojpoa go kapmao le cundo. ifa, pei cutse dio mi lepo pei pazi kamla le prenyhaa, enurau, no kanmo go furvea su tcidi guo,  e begco lepo mi furvea su tcidi lui.




#and I was waiting a bit, but after some time obliged by opening the window.   


#And then they said to me that they had just come from prison, and were not able to buy food,


#and asked if I would buy them food, please.


i mi crano, e dapli lepo mi hapci furvea lui. i buo, ga mutce natli, ice miu no kanmo go nergoi le resra.


 inurau, mi letci lepo pei nergoi lemi tcaro guo, ice miu godzi le tcastobegsia.


#And I smiled and said I would happily buy [food] for them.  But it was late at night, and we could not go into the restaurant.


#Thus, I let them ride in my care, and we went through the drive-through.  [I do not understand <nergoi> here:  but this is some derivative of to go:  actually it is <nengoi>]


i zou, mi piazi penso lezo ga gudbi nurdii ga lepo letci lepo ne pernu ji pazi kamla su prenyhaa ga nergoi lemi tcaro, ibuo mi krido peu lepei nurcue, e gua danza go helba su pernu ji cnida. 


 ibuo mi krido peu lepei nurcue, e gua danza go helba su pernu ji cnida. 


#Incidentally, I had briefly thought about how good a decision it might be to let a person who had come from prison into my car,


#[<nengoi>] but I believed in what they said, and habitually want to help a person in need.


i mi furvea su tcidi lui, e tcabei dio le hasfa je lepei fremi. i pei gatcue, efa, godzi.


i coi lepei nurcue, pei pa speni ro mutce zalzao, ice mi kecri kecri peu. 


i buo, mi hapci lepo mi pa kanmo go donsu dio pei su cmalo hapcko. i aeae pei speni su gudmou fazi, soi crano.


#I bought some food for them, and gave them a ride to the house of their friend, and they thanked [me] and went.


#And by their words, they had experienced very bad things, and I cried and cried about it.


#But I was happy that I was able to give them some small cause for happiness.  And I hope things will be better for them :-)

#It is rather gender-normative, isnt it...dont we have a word for "child"?  We do...<tciha>   But it means offspring. Ra pernu ga tciha...


#It would be a good project to develop an alternative word.
