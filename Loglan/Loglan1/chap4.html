<H2><A NAME="sec4.1">4.1</A> Designation vs. Predication</H2>

<P>In the previous chapter we talked about the ways in which a speaker could use the predicate apparatus of a language to make claims, to give information, to frame new insights, and so forth. But to use a predicate is also to indicate one's willingness to show one's listeners how to use or test the truth of the relationship or perception that it claims. If I tell you 'X is taller than Y' or 'Z is an intellectual dwarf', I must evidently be prepared to answer such questions as 'How do you know?' 'In what way?' 'How can I tell?' and so on. For if I am a knowing and responsible speaker, I must be able to follow up any such use of a predicate with such remarks as 'Well, if you talk to Z, you will find he is no intellectual giant', or 'If you put X and Y back to back and hold a carpenter's level over their heads, and then keep it level while you lower it, you will find that it touches X's head before it touches Y's.' In fact if I cannot follow up my predications with instructions of this--or some other--sort, people will begin to suspect that I don't know what I am talking about.</P>
<!-- .H4.2 THE DEMONSTRATIVE VARIABLES TI TA -->
<P>But you might also ask an entirely different kind of question about either of these same remarks. You might ask 'Who's X?' or 'Who's Z?' Obviously the most elaborate instructions for testing the claim that X is taller than Y, or the most illuminating comment on Z's dwarfed intellectuality, will not be of much use unless you know the identity of the individuals to whom these predicates are supposed to apply. And again, just by using such arguments as 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' in such remarks I am evidently indicating my willingness to help you locate the objects to which my predicates apply. For example, I might answer 'X is that red-haired fellow standing over there.' And again, if I am unwilling or unable to give you locating information of this--or some other--sort, people are likely to suspect that I don't know <EM>who</EM> I am talking about.</P>
<P>But the two kinds of information are very different. To tell you what I mean by a predication is to give you a recipe for testing it, on anything. But to tell you to whom or on what I intend that predication to apply, is to give you the address, so to speak, of just those objects. Predicates make claims. Arguments designate the individuals, or sets of individuals, those claims are about. By one linguistic convention or another, they help the listener to locate those things in space-time.</P>
<P>Suppose I say 'I am taller than you are.' You will not, if you understand English, have to inquire who or what I mean to designate by the arguments 'I' and 'you'. For you will know that anyone who uses 'I' in an English sentence means to designate himself, and here I am. Similarly, if I am gazing directly at you when you hear me say 'you', you will have no difficulty in locating the second object I have designated. For by a similar convention of spoken English you know that 'you' designates the person addressed, and here you are, too. In contrast, the references of 'X' and 'Y', like those of the pronouns 'he', 'she' and 'it', are not so easily located. Like the Loglan variables <B>da</B>, <B>de</B> and <B>di</B>, they require a context of previously-spoken sentences from which to infer what they mean. I can start out talking about you and me, for you know immediately who we are; but I cannot usually start talking to you in sentences in which the only arguments are 'he' and 'she' or <B>da</B> and <B>de</B>. For, as we shall see, the conventions of both Loglan and English require that I use these "third person" variables to refer to things which have already been referred to in some other way.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>This, then, was the essential artificiality of the sentences we studied in the preceding chapter. None of their arguments designated anything; for no listener could have located the things to which those arguments apparently referred. We must now look more closely into these matters. We will find that very special conventions surround the machinery of designation in any language. When successfully used, these conventions lead to the possibility of the listener's locating the things to which the speaker has referred. Just how these locating conventions are arranged in Loglan is the subject of the present chapter.<SUP><A HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP></P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.2">4.2</A> The Demonstrative Variables <B>ti ta</B></H2>


<P>The simplest way a speaker can locate something for a listener is by pointing to it. Then if, in addition, he wishes to say something about the object at which he is pointing, most languages provide one or more convenient little words to serve as arguments of the predicate which says that thing. In Loglan the variables <B>ti</B> [tee] and <B>ta</B> [tah] serve this "demonstrative" function, as in the following sentences:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ti bukcu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">This is a book.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/tiBUKcu/</CENTER>
</P>
<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ta bakso </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">That's a box.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/taBAKso/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Just as in English there are two of these words. The convention is that if two objects are to be demonstratively designated, <B>ti</B> will be used for the closer or the later of them, while <B>ta</B> will be used for the farther or the earlier. If only one object is to be referred to, either <B>ti</B> or <B>ta</B> may be used.</P>
<P>The relationship between both <B>ti</B> and <B>ta</B> and the thing it refers to is usually a transitory one. Thus in the same context of speech I may use the word <B>ti</B> many different times to refer to many different things. For example, I may walk down a row of objects on a shelf and refer to each of them in turn as <B>ti</B>, just as I may say 'This is a cat; this is a dog; this is a mouse' in English. In this respect, the demonstrative variables differ from the other variables we are about to study in that their references may vary within the same context of speech. They are in this sense the <EM>most</EM> variable of the Loglan argument forms.</P>


<!-- .H4.4 THE FREE VARIABLES DA DE DI DO DU -->

<H2><A NAME="sec4.3">4.3</A> The Metalinguistic Demonstratives <B>toi toa tio tao</B></H2>


<P>Sometimes when we use 'this' and 'that' in English we aren't referring to objects in the world immediately around us but to something someone has said or alluded to. Thus when someone says something we agree with, we often say 'That's true.' In a logical language one must keep references of that kind distinct from references to the object world. This is the same difference--first pointed out by the positivist philosopher Rudolf Carnap--that philosophers now refer to as the difference between the "object language" and the "metalanguage". In its simplest terms the <EM>metalanguage</EM> is the language we use to talk about language. 'That's true' is an excellent example. We use the pair of demonstratives <B>toi</B> [toy] and <B>toa</B> [toh-ah] for this metalinguistic purpose in Loglan.</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Toi tradu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">That's true (literally, this is true).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/toiTRAdu/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Toa falji [FAHL-zhee] </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">That's false (that earlier claim was false).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/toaFALji/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>On most occasions of their use, disyllabic operators like [toh-ah] will have "level stress"; that is, neither syllable will be stressed.</P>
<P>But there is still another kind of demonstrative pronoun. Suppose someone tells you 'John is sick today.' You say 'That's bad!' Is it da's sentence you are referring to? No; it is the situation described by that sentence that you are saying is bad. So neither <B>Ta zavlo</B> ('That object over there is bad!') nor <B>Toa zavlo</B> ('That sentence you uttered is bad, i.e., ill-formed') will do. In a logical language we need still a third pair of demonstratives to refer to the absent situations to which the sentences spoken in our immediate vicinity often refer. In Loglan we use <B>tio</B> [tyoh] and <B>tao</B> [tow] for this <EM>meta</EM>-metalinguistic purpose.</P>


<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(3)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Tio zavlo </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">This is bad (i.e., the situation just alluded to is bad).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/tioZAVlo/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Tao gudbi </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">That's good (the situation previously alluded to is good).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/taoGUDbi/</CENTER>
</P>


<P>In English we tend to use 'that' in both these situations. We say 'That's bad' and 'That's good' whether the allusion was made in the most recent sentence or not. Possibly this is because of the remoteness from the scene of speech of the meta-metalinguistical world.</P>
<P>So in Loglan we have three pairs of demonstratives: <B>ti ta</B> for immediately perceived things; <B>toi toa</B> for pieces of recent speech or writing; and <B>tio tao</B> for absent situations to which pieces of recent speech or writing allude.</P>
<P>As a speaker of a logical language you will find these distinctions very useful...even though the chances are very good that you have never made them before.<SUP><A HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP></P>


<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->

<H2><A NAME="sec4.4">4.4</A> The Free Variables <B>da de di do du</B></H2>


<P>These are the argument-forms that we used without comment throughout the previous chapter. You sensed in that context that they were very like the X Y Z's of the mathematician. This is correct; for unlike the English third person pronouns which they often translate, the Loglan free variables may stand for anything at all: single things or plural sets of things ('it' or 'they'), subjects or objects ('he' or 'him'), animate or inanimate things ('she' or 'it'), and males or females ('him' or 'her'). Moreover, each of the five free variables may be used in any of these ways.</P>
<P>Like English third person pronouns, Loglan free variables are usually introduced into speech as short replacements of other, longer designations that have already been made. For example, in the sequence of English sentences,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Christopher Columbus visited the Queen of Spain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) He persuaded her that the Earth was round.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>the pronouns 'he' and 'her' in (2) replace the longer designations 'Christopher Columbus' and 'the Queen of Spain' that first occurred in (1). In Loglan we often make the same kind of replacement with free variables. As in English, they may replace (i) names, (ii) descriptions, and (iii) demonstratives. They may <EM>not</EM> replace each other or the Loglan equivalents of 'I' and 'you'. In a moment you will see why.</P>
<P>Now the reason that pronouns are often inflected for number and gender in the natural languages is primarily to allow the listener to make a fair guess at the identity of the name, description or demonstrative for which each pronoun is a substitute. For example, it is because we know the genders of Christophers and queens, that we can be fairly certain that 'he' replaces 'Christopher Columbus' and 'her' replaces 'the Queen of Spain' and not the other way round. But the Loglan variables are totally uninflected. Obviously, some other system of identifying the objects they replaced must be found.<SUP><A HREF="#note3">3</A></SUP></P>
<!-- .H4.4 THE FREE VARIABLES DA DE DI DO DU -->
<P>In Loglan the replacement system governing the references of free variables is based on the order in which they are used. It is as if, when speech commences, the five free variables were sitting on a shelf in alphabetical order in both the speaker's and the listener's mind. Then as speech progresses they are continually matched up with the arguments they might replace in the sentences that have already occurred. When a free variable <EM>is</EM> used to replace another argument, it is taken off the shelf, so to speak, and the others are shifted along it to form a new order. The matching with potential replacements then proceeds as before. Let us illustrate this process with an example.</P>
<P>Suppose someone commences a conversation by pointing to something and saying:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(3)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">La Djan, pa vedma ta le fumna </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">John sold that to the woman.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/laDJAN.paVEDmataleFUMna/</CENTER></P>

<P>In this sentence there is a name (<B>La Djan</B>), a demonstrative (<B>ta</B>) and a description (<B>le fumna</B>). All of them are replaceable by free variables. Let us see how.</P>
<P>Suppose the speaker now wants to add that the woman who bought the indicated object then gave it to a person named Pete. Well, the five free variables are all unused, and as he spoke sentence (3) the speaker unconsciously matched the first of them, <B>da</B>, with the last designation in the previous sentence, which is the one it <EM>may</EM> replace, namely <B>le fumna</B>. So <B>da</B> is now available to talk about the woman. But the speaker also unconsciously matched the second free variable, <B>de</B>, with the second-from-the-last argument used, namely <B>ta</B>. So <B>de</B> is available as a more permanent designation of that object than <B>ta</B> is. (Recall that the demonstratives are temporary designations and may not be used a second time to designate the same thing.) Finally, the third-from-the-last designation is <B>La Djan</B>; this has been matched by the speaker with the third variable <B>di</B>. And if he wanted to mention John again, the speaker could now do so by using the variable <B>di</B>.</P>
<P>But he doesn't. What he wants to say is that the woman--who is potentially <B>da</B>--gave the object--which is potentially <B>de</B>--to some new person named Pete. So he says:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da pa donsu la Pit, de</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X gave Pete Y.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dapaDONsulaPIT.de/</CENTER>
</P>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Now because the listener--let us suppose, for our referential convenience, a woman--is playing by the same rules, she has also made this same unconscious matching; and she therefore knows that <B>da</B> refers to the same object as the last previous designation, namely <B>le fumna</B>, does, and that <B>de</B> replaces the second-to-the-last designation she has heard, namely <B>ta</B>. Moreover, had she heard the variable <B>di</B> she would have known that it referred to John. But she didn't.</P>
<P>Now as soon as these two variables, <B>da</B> and <B>de</B>, come off the shelves in the speaker's and listener's mind, then a new matching must be made. For if the speaker thinks back over what he has <EM>now</EM> said he will find that the last replaceable designation he has made is not <B>La Djan</B> in (3) but <B>la Pit</B> in (4). Consequently, after speaking sentence (4) a new matching set-up is formed in the speaker's and listener's mind in which <B>di</B> now matches <B>la Pit</B> and the fourth variable <B>do</B> now refers back to <B>La Djan</B>. Both of the other replaceable designations in these two remarks, namely <B>le fumna</B> and <B>ta</B>, have already been replaced by <B>da</B> and <B>de</B> and therefore stand outside the new matching scheme.</P>
<P>So the speaker may continue:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(5)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Do pa mercea [mehr-SHEIGH-ah] da </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">W married (married-became to) X.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dopamerCEade/ </CENTER>
</P>

<P>And who is X? The woman once designated by <B>le fumna</B>. And who is W, the "designatum" of (that is, the thing or person designated by) the fourth free variable? Why John, of course. Had the speaker wished to say that it was Pete who married the woman X, he would have said:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(6)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Di pa mercea da</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Z married X.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dipamerCEada/</CENTER></P>

<P>For at the time he spoke, <B>di</B> was matched with the name <B>la Pit</B>.</P>
<P>This seems tricky, but you will probably find it easy and natural to assign up to three free variables in this way. It will usually be clear to you when you are listening to or speaking Loglan just which among the five free variables have been used. The rest remain in alphabetical order on their shelf waiting for the speaker to use them. Thus after sentences (3), (4) and (5) the variables <B>da</B>, <B>de</B> and <B>do</B> have been used to replace <B>le fumna</B>, <B>ta</B> and <B>la Djan</B>, respectively. Throughout the rest of this conversation--or the current paragraph in text--these three variables will remain more or less permanently assigned to the objects and persons designated by the original expressions, i.e., to their designata. At the end of utterance (5) only <B>di</B> and <B>du</B> remain unused. These will be ready to be matched to whatever is the last and next-to-last replaceable designation, respectively, at any subsequent moment in the conversation. Experience has shown, however, that even a fourth free variable is rarely used in speech.</P>
<!-- .H4.5 THE PERSONAL VARIABLES MI &amp; TU -->
<P>Writing is a different matter. With one's text in front of one, not only can all five replacing variables be rapidly assigned, but one can run out of variables fairly fast. When this happens, subscripted variables may be used. These are compounds like <B>dacine</B> [dah-shee-neh], <B>dacito</B> [dah-shee-toh], etc.--these compounds, too, normally get level stress--which are the Loglan equivalents of expressions like English 'X-sub-one', 'X-sub-two', and so on. There are in principle an infinite number of these, of course, so once the writer starts on them, da is not likely to run out of variables again. But the five unsubscripted variables <B>da de di do du</B> will suffice for organizing the references in most ordinary text.<SUP><A HREF="#note4">4</A></SUP></P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.5">4.5</A> The Personal Variables <B>mi tu</B> and Their Derivatives</H2>


<P>The personal variables of Loglan are much more numerous than the personal pronouns of English, but they are used in much the same way. The basic words are <B>mi</B> [mee] and <B>tu</B> [too] which, as you may easily guess, mean 'I' (or 'me') and 'you', respectively. Thus:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Mi cluva [SHLOO-vah] tu</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">I love you.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/miCLUvatu/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Tu cluva mi</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">You love me.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/tuCLUvami/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Note that neither of these words is inflected for its position in the sentence. It is as if we said 'Me love you' in English, as, in fact, some children and speakers of Pidgin English do.<SUP><A HREF="#note5">5</A></SUP></P>
<P>There is no distinction in Loglan between the formal and informal senses of 'you' as there is in French and German. In this respect Loglan is like modern English and unlike nearly all of the other European languages. For almost all these languages still carry this mark of the sharp class-distinctions amongst the people who spoke these languages in the past.<SUP><A HREF="#note6">6</A></SUP></P>
<P>A third personal variable is <B>mu</B> [moo], a phonemic mixture of <B>mi</B> and <B>tu</B>. Naturally it means 'we' or 'us'. In fact, <B>mu</B> is an abbreviation of the "mixed" argument form <B>mi ze tu</B> ('I and you jointly'), the exact meaning of which we will consider in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.35">Section 4.35</A>. For the moment it is enough to know that this is the "proposing" or "planning" sense of English 'we' or 'us', as in the sequence 'Let's go. We'll visit Jack. Then we'll eat.'  The pronoun <B>mo</B> captures the <B>mi, e tu</B> sense of "me and you": when we both do something separately, rather than together, <B>mo</B> is the correct pronoun to use.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>There is another sense of the pronoun 'we' in English. For example, the sense of 'we' in the following sentences is not that of <B>mi ze tu</B>: 'John and I went to Spain. We stayed there for a while, and then we went on to Italy.' Obviously I do not mean to include you, my listener, in this "narrative" sense of 'we'. <!-- So for precision of reference we have another set of personal variables in Loglan which mean 'X and I', 'Y and I', and so on. These are <B>mia mie mii mio miu</B> [myah myeh myee myoh myoo]. As you may easily infer, these words are abbreviations of the mixed forms <B>mi ze da</B> ('I and X jointly'), <B>mi ze de</B> ('I and Y jointly'), and so on. --> We have the personal pronoun <B>miu</B>, meaning roughly <B>mi ze da</B>, for joint actions of such a "we", and <B>mio</B>, meaning roughly <B>mi, e da</B>, for non-joint predication of the same thing to the various participants in such a "we".</P>
<!-- <P>Like the free variables, replacement with these mixed variables is determined by order. Thus in translating the English narrative above, we would use <B>mie</B> for 'we' because the name 'John' in 'John and I went to Spain' is the second-to-the-last replaceable designation at the moment the replacement occurred ('Spain' was the last). Note that 'I', being a permanent designation of any speaker, is not replaceable and therefore is not counted in reckoning the replacement order of 'John'. Since all designations made with personal variables are permanent in the passages in which they occur, they are never replaced by free variables.</P> -->
<P>There is a third, less frequently occurring sense of 'we' in English for which Loglan also provides distinct words. This is the <B>mu ze da</B> sense of 'we': the mixed first, second and third person sense of the pronoun 'we' in 'We (you and I and the children) will visit the Louvre first, then we'll go to Notre Dame, then the Left Bank...' and so on. This is the "group planning" sense of 'we'. So this mixture of references is expressed in Loglan with the <!-- <B>mua</B>-series, <B>mua mue mui muo muu</B> [mwah mweh mwee mwoh mwoo]; and <B>mua</B> is, we see, a very compact abbreviation of <B>mi ze tu ze da</B>.--> pronoun <B>muu</B>, which has a correlate <B>muo</B> with the sense of <B>mu, e da</B>.</P>

We now introduce various forms of "you".  <B>tou</B> refers to a plural "you" acting jointly;  <B>too</B> refers to a plural you acting individually ("each of you...");  <B>tuu</B> has the sense of <B>tu ze da</B> and <B>tuo</B> has the sense of <B>tu, e da</B>.<p>

<!-- .H4.6 THE 100 LETTER VARIABLES -->
<!-- <P>The final series of personal variables is one in which the members have the sense of English plural 'you' when it means a mixture of second and third person references: thus 'you (the listener) and X', 'you and Y', and so on. These abbreviations are of course generated from the mixed argument forms <B>tu ze da</B>, <B>tu ze de</B>, and so on, and are simply <B>tua tue tui tuo tuu</B> [twah tweh twee twoh twoo]. Again the rules of replacement for free variables apply.</P> -->
<P>The total number of Loglan personal variables is a moderately large ten.<SUP><A HREF="#rnote1">R1</A></SUP><!-- But as fifteen of these come in five-member series, and as all but the primitive elements <B>mi</B> and <B>tu</B> are plain abbreviations of <B>ze</B>-linked phrases, they hardly have to be learned.

<P>With the personal variables we complete our account of the words which function as pronouns in Loglan. In summary, these are (i) the six demonstratives <B>ti ta</B>, <B>toi toa</B> and <B>tio tao</B>, (ii) the five free variables of the <B>da</B>-series <B>da de di do du</B>; and (iii) <B>mi tu mu</B> and their ten derivatives.

<H2><A NAME="sec4.6">4.6</A> The Letter Variables</H2>


<P>Loglan, which frequently uses those compact visual forms beloved by mathematicians, has an unusually large supply of letter variables: the 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd's of the mathematician and logician. Each letter variable is available in two forms, first as a word--in most cases three-letters long, e.g., <B>bei</B>--and second as a single-character written sign, in this case <B>b</B>. The parser does not understand single characters, though this usage will no doubt be attested.  The Loglan letter words and letter signs are used exactly as the English number words ('one') and numerals ('1') are used, in that each numeral is a visually compact form of its corresponding word that is used optionally in print or writing. In fact, Loglan letter signs are called "letterals" on the model of the English word 'numeral'.</P>
<P>We enumerate these word/letteral pairs in Loglan.<SUP><A HREF ="#rnote2">R2</A></SUP> There are 46 words for the 46 Latin letterals, the 23 lower plus the 23 upper case ones. (<B>A</B> and <B>a</B> are different letterals in Loglan, as indeed they are different graphs in English, and so deserve different words by which to speak them.) There are 24 three-letter words for the 24 lower case Greek letterals.  There are special words <B>haiu/heiu</B>, <B>kaiu/keiu</B>, <B>vaiu/veiu</B> which correspond to the non-Loglan letters <B>X/x, Q/q, W/w</B>.<!--, because the 24 capital letter words are made by prefixing <B>gao-</B> [gow] to the three-letter word for the corresponding lower-case letteral. This is because so few Greek capital letterals differ from the corresponding Latin capitals that there is little use for upper-case Greek letter-words.--)</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
 The words loglanists use for reading letterals aloud--words like the seldom written but often spoken English 'tee', 'eks', 'eff' and 'cue', and the both written and spoken 'alpha', 'beta' and 'gamma' of Greek--are generated in Loglan by adding <B>-ei</B> [-ay] and <B>-ai</B> [-igh] to the lower and upper case Latin consonant letters, respectively. This generates the series <B>bei cei dei</B>... [bay shay day...] for the lower-case letterals and <B>Bai Cai Dai</B>... [bigh shigh digh...] for the capitals. The Latin vowel words are either the seven vowel letters pronounced according to their sounds, <B>a e i o u y</B> as [ah eh ee oh oo uh], when it isn't important to distinguish them from the connectives <B>a e i o u</B>, and when case and language (Greek or Latin) doesn't matter, or by three-letter words formed by attaching <B>-fi</B> and <B>-ma</B> to the vowel letterals when it is. Thus <B>afi efi ifi</B>... [ah-fee ef-ee ee-fee...] are the three-letter words for the lower case Latin vowels, and <B>Ama Ema Ima</B>... [ahm-ah em-ah eem-ah...] represent the capitals. Again, the most typical pronunciation of these disyllables is with level stress.  There is a new series of names for the vowels with preferable phonetic properties, but with the vowels themselves not initial:  in this scheme the name for a vowel V is <B>ziV</B> and the capital letter is <B>ziVma</B>:  the parser for the moment accepts both <B>zia</B> and <B>afi</b> for lower case <B>a</B> and both <B>Ama</B> and <B>Ziama</B> for upper case <B>A</B>.
<P>The Loglan words for the Greek consonant letters--words which function like 'beta', 'gamma', and so on, in English--are formed in Loglan by adding the suffix <B>-eo</B> [-eigh-oh] to all the consonants except <B>c</B> because there is no sound in Greek that corresponds to Loglan [sh]. This generates <B>beo deo feo</B>... [beigh-oh deigh-oh feigh-oh...] for the lower-case Greek consonant letter-words. The Loglan lower case Greek vowel letters are formed by suffixing the vowel with <B>-zi</B>.<!-- As mentioned above, <B>gao</B>- is added to these three-letter forms to make the occasional Greek capital. Thus <B>gaoseo</B> [gow-seigh-oh] is the word for capital sigma, whose letteral does in fact differ from Latin 'S'. <B>Seo</B> [seigh-oh] of course is lower case sigma. Greek lower-case vowel-words are made in forms parallel to the Latin ones by adding <B>-fi</B> to all the Loglan vowel-sounds except <B>w</B>--like <B>c</B>, Loglan <B>w</B> [eu] is not assigned to any letter in the Greek alphabet--whenever it is useful to distinguish between cases or languages: <B>afi efi ifi</B>... [ah-fee eff-ee ee-fee...]. The words for the Greek capital vowels--on the rare occasions when they are required--are <B>gao,afi gao,efi gao,ifi</B>... [gow-ah-fee gow-eh-fee gow-ee-fee...]. (Note the close-commas. This forces vowel-pairing from the left, and is one of the rare occasions when the "pair-from-the-right" rule mentioned in <A HREF="chap2.html#sec2.15">Section 2.15</A> is departed from in non-names. Because it is a departure from standard pronunciation, it is marked.)</P> -->
<!-- <P>Remember that each of the 100 three- and six-letter words so generated may be represented in text in two ways: first, as a phonemically spelled word--<B>Tai</B>, for example, which translates the phrase 'capital tee' in English--and second, by its single-letter abbreviation, in this case the letteral <B>T</B>. Both representations are pronounced as the word itself is spelled, in the case of <B>T</B> and <B>Tai</B> as [tigh]. Thus the two differently written sentences:</P>

<P>The text is now in the maximally condensed visual form we see in mathematics books. But the sentences of (6) are pronounced exactly like those of (5)...in both languages.

<P>The mathematized style of Loglan is still being explored.

<H2><A NAME="sec4.7">4.7</A> Naming with <B>la</B></H2>


<P>We must now make explicit a convention that we have used informally for some time. That convention is that when names are used as designations in Loglan, they are preceded by the little word <B>la</B> [lah]. For example, the presence and absence of <B>la</B> is the only difference between the following two sentences:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">La Djan, godzi </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">John goes.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/DJAN.GODzi/</CENTER></P>

<!-- .H4.8 DESCRIPTION WITH LE -->
<P>In sentence (1), the name operator <B>la</B> has made a designation out of the name-word <B>Djan</B> which follows it. That is, <B>La Djan</B> refers to something, namely to a person named John. Since it refers to something, it is an argument, namely the first argument of the predicate <B>godzi</B>. Therefore the sentence as a whole is a statement; it claims something to be true of John, namely that he goes.</P>
<P>In sentence (2), however, the name-word <B>Djan</B> is used vocatively, that is, used to call the attention of someone named John:  vocative uses of a name require the marker <B>hoi</B> (or related words of social lubrication). This leaves the predicate <B>godzi</B> without a first argument; and, as we will see in detail later, a sentence whose predicate does not have a first argument is not a statement but an imperative. It forms the injunction 'Go!'. Evidently the presence or absence of the little word <B>la</B> makes some difference in Loglan.</P>
<P>The distinction between the designative and the vocative use of names is not regularly drawn in the natural languages. And yet there is a very important difference in meaning. People designate someone by using da's name in much the same spirit that they describe someone by using some predicate that fits da. Thus we may designate someone by saying 'He's the fat one over there' or by saying 'He's the one named John over there.' Thus having a name is a kind of property, namely the property shared by all who have that name. We use this property in using names to make designations. We say, in effect, 'the one named John'.</P>
<P>This is exactly what the name-operator <B>la</B> does in Loglan. In sentence (1) <B>La Djan</B> means literally 'The one person I mean whose name is John'. This is a mouthful, and no one would ever translate Loglan into English in this way. But English is not explicit about these matters. Loglan is. It perhaps expresses the sense of the Loglan best to write sentences like (1) as '<EM>The</EM> John goes' whenever a literal translation is desired. Again, this is not a routine one would care to impose on unwarned ears. But it does suggest, as 'John goes' does not, the sense in which the Loglan sentence, but not the English, explicitly recognizes that there are many Johns.</P>


<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->

<H2><A NAME="sec4.8">4.8</A> Description with <B>le</B></H2>


<P>Just as names may be used to form designations, so may predicates. Thus the little word <B>le</B> [leh] operates on predicate expressions to make designations out of them in a way that is similar to the way <B>la</B> operates on name-words. We will call the designations made with <B>le</B> <EM>descriptions</EM>, and <B>le</B> itself, the <EM>descriptive operator</EM>. For in this context we are using predicates, not to say things about the world, but to locate those things <EM>in</EM> the world about which we have something to say. Thus with <B>la</B> we locate things by naming them; with <B>le</B> we locate things by imputing other properties to them. For example, in</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Le fumna pa cluva le mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">The woman loved the man.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/leFUMnapaCLUvaleMREnu/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>the predicate words <B>fumna</B> and <B>mrenu</B> are not predications, for they claim nothing. Instead, they function in this sentence to help the listener locate the two objects in the world about which the speaker <EM>does</EM> have something to say, namely that one of them loved the other. Thus, descriptions are not true or false of the things they describe, but merely helpful or not helpful. This can best be seen by considering a fanciful example.</P>
<P>Suppose someone who looks like a woman is arrested by two detectives on suspicion of some crime. Later the suspect is more thoroughly examined and found to be a man. Suppose the first detective reports this fact to the second by saying 'That woman was a man.' Is this a contradiction? Certainly not. For by describing the suspect as 'that woman' the first detective has not <EM>said</EM> that the suspect is in fact a woman. It is not the linguistic business of designation to assert facts, but to <EM>use</EM> facts, or apparent facts, to help listeners locate individuals. The fact is that the suspect looked like a woman. And that fact is useful in locating him.</P>
<P>For we can now ask a very different kind of question. Was it <EM>useful</EM> to the listener to have the suspect described to de as 'that woman'? Certainly. For this is exactly what de needed to know in order to locate the person who was in fact a man. Suppose the second detective had been told 'That man was a man.' Would this have been useful to de? We suppose not. We suppose, in fact, that nothing would have been more misleading to that as yet uninformed listener. For it is worse than useless to be told to locate an object by means of a property you think that object does not have!</P>
<!-- .H4.8 DESCRIPTION WITH LE -->
<P>Notice that the sentences 'That woman was a man' and 'That man was a man' are both true under the circumstances we have assumed. But only one of them has any chance of communicating that truth to the listener; and that is the one that uses a "false" but useful description as the designation of the individual the sentence is about.</P>
<P>But, however these matters may be interpreted in English, the sentence</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Le fumna pa mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">The woman was a man.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/leFUMnapaMREnu/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>is not a contradiction in Loglan. The reason is that the descriptive operator <B>le</B> does not simply mean 'the', or 'the one that is', but more exactly 'the one thing, or set of things, which I intend to designate with this phrase and which is apparently a...'. Thus there are many women, and many things which look like women, but the speaker of sentence (2) intends to designate just one of them, and a certain one of them, when da says that it was a man. That one intended thing <EM>is</EM> the reference of the descriptive phrase. And the sentence containing that phrase is true or false depending only on whether its predicate, not its description, is true of that intended thing.<SUP><A HREF="#note8">8</A></SUP></P>
<P>Now any untensed and unspecified predicate expression of the language can become the basis of a description with <B>le</B>. Thus the predicate expression <B>bilti cmalo ge nirli ckela</B> provides the description</P>

<P>In short, one must occasionally make rather radical adjustments to the English in transporting a predicate notion into or out of a Loglan description.

<!-- <P>In Chapter 3 we observed that predicate strings with "kekked head predas" were not allowed in predicate expressions but were permitted in descriptions. It is easy to see why.

And what are these objects? Well, if you think about it, anyone who talks like this in English is talking about all the butter there is, all the water there is, and all the human beings there are, for this is the sense of the English noun when it is used without an article. (Contrast '<EM>The</EM> man is in trouble.') But is this a legitimate way of talking? Perhaps; but it is certainly a different way than talking about pieces of butter, glasses of water, or individual human beings.</P>
<P>In Loglan we recognize this important difference explicitly by providing a different operator <B>lo</B> [loh] to form these <EM>mass descriptions</EM>, as we will now call them. (To English-listening ears [loh] has a very abrupt, even truncated sound. It is <EM>not</EM>, for example, the sound of English 'low' [loh-oo].) Let us consider some examples.</P>
<P>The Loglan predicate <B>batra</B> means 'is a piece, portion or lump of butter'. The predicate <B>cutri</B> means 'is a drop, portion, body or expanse of water'. The predicate <B>humni</B> means 'is a human being'. Thus <B>le batra</B>, <B>le cutri</B> and <B>le humni</B> designate the particular lump of butter, the particular drop (let us say) of water, and the particular particle of humanity which the speaker has in mind. But <B>lo batra</B>, <B>lo cutri</B> and <B>lo humni</B> designate just what the English words 'butter', 'water' and 'man' designate when used without articles, namely those three massive, widely distributed but discontinuous individuals composed respectively of <EM>all</EM> the butter, <EM>all</EM> the water, and <EM>all</EM> the human beings there are. Looking back, we will now call descriptions made with <B>le</B> <EM>particular descriptions</EM>, to contrast them with the mass descriptions with which we are now concerned.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>English permits us to talk of these massive individuals in a wide variety of ways. In the case of what some grammarians call the "uncountable" nouns--substance words like 'butter', 'sand', 'wood', 'meat', 'iron', etc.--the procedure is very simple. One simply uses the unadorned noun, as in 'Iron is hard.' What is awkward in the case of <EM>these</EM> nouns is talking about individual pieces. For one must say in English 'The piece (lump, fragment, chunk) of iron', not simply <B>le fernu</B> ('the iron-thing') as one can in Loglan. For other nouns--the "countable" English nouns like 'book', 'chair', 'spoon', etc.--we sometimes use the plural to express this massively constructed individual ('Books are important to man'), and sometimes the singular with the definite article ('The lion is found all over Africa'). It is usually obvious from the context that the speaker does <EM>not</EM> mean to talk about all or any books or lions as individual particles. Thus it is not the case that every book is important to humankind, and it is certainly not true that any particular lion is found all over Africa. It is the mass individual <EM>Felis leo</EM> who has spread his tawny presence over Africa. But the trouble with these English designations is that they are not very distinctive. Thus with the same grammatical constructions one can also designate quite particular things or sets of things ('The lion roared', 'Books were on the table'). The English listener must, as usual, guess from context what kind of creature the speaker has in mind...although we are so used to doing this in English that it does not seem to us to be a very difficult thing to do.</P>
<P>In Loglan a distinct grammatical form exists for each of these distinct mechanisms of designation. There can be no doubt that the Loglan speaker who says <B>lo simba</B> is designating lion-kind, and that <B>lo bukcu</B> means that massive individual composed of all the books there are or have been or ever will be. For there is no restriction in Loglan on the kind of predicate to which the <B>lo</B> operator may be applied. Even the most countable things can be massified, and the most uncountable things particularized; for Loglan does not divide the world up in this way.</P>
<P>Before we leave mass descriptions it is worth pointing out that the languages of some preliterate peoples apparently employ the idea of mass description as the elementary meaning of their basic predicate words. Thus the Trobriand Islanders are reported to place this interpretation on all their nouns; whence the curious world-view arises that what we Indo-Europeans would call a single instance of a thing is, to them, nothing but a part, or reappearance, or manifestation of the same, massive individual thing. Thus every rabbit is just another appearance of Mr. Rabbit; every yam just another manifestation of Mr. Yam; every baby just a part of Mr. Baby all over again. I don't know if many Trobrianders will learn Loglan, but if they do they will find an apparatus readily available in it with which to describe the world exactly as they see it. And the <B>lo</B>-operator will be as common in their speech as <B>le</B> will be in yours and mine.<SUP><A HREF="#note11">11</A></SUP></P>


<!-- .H4.10 QUOTATION WITH LI...LU AND LIU LIE -->

<H2><A NAME="sec4.10">4.10</A> Quotation with <B>li</B>...<B>lu</B> and <B>liu lie</B></H2>


<P>In the last three sections we have discussed three very similar ways of forming designations in Loglan: (i) naming with <B>la</B>, (ii) describing particular things with <B>le</B>, and (iii) describing masses of things with <B>lo</B>. There is a fourth kind of designation, namely description by quotation; and for this we will need the marks <B>li</B>...<B>lu</B> [lee...loo], <B>liu</B> [lee-oo] and <B>lie</B> [lee-EH], the second syllable in the last word being nearly always stressed.</P>
<P>Not only are all punctuation marks spoken words in Loglan, as we have observed before, but the affinities of quotation marks with the other descriptive operators of Loglan is phonemically clear. Thus the very sound of the word <B>li</B> suggests that it is related to the descriptors <B>la</B>, <B>le</B> and <B>lo</B>, all in some sense meaning 'the'. And so it is. For just as <B>le</B> means 'the one I mean that is...', and <B>la</B> means 'the one I mean named...', so <B>li</B> means 'the thing I mean that looks or sounds like...'. Thus quotation is really description by imitation.</P>

<P>In (1) the speaker has imitated a portion of Loglan speech or writing--perhaps copied it from a book--and put the imitation between the marks <B>li,</B> and <B>, lu</B> in order to quote it. Note that pauses--represented as usual by commas in text--are also required around the quoted string. This style of quotation is called <EM>weak quotation</EM>. With it any string of well-formed Loglan may be unambiguously quoted.</P>
<P>But sometimes we wish to quote ill-formed strings...including some that might have an extra <EM>lu</EM> in it, which would baffle the machine. Even foreign utterances, in which there's no predicting how many stray <EM>lu</EM>'s there might be, also need to be quoted. For these two occasions Loglan has a more robust style of quotation called <EM>strong quotation</EM>. This is done with the strong quotation article <B>lie</B>.  For example,</P>

The word <B>lie</B> is followed by one or more quoted blocks of text separated by the little word <B>y</B>.
The phonetic value of the quoted blocks of text is not determined by Loglan;  they may not contain commas, spaces, or marks of terminal punctuation; the final block may be closed by such punctuation as here.  Whatever the sounds of the blocks may be, they do not contain pauses and are set off by pauses from the <B>lie</B> that precedes them, from medial <B>y</B> that separates them, and from what follows them.<SUP><A HREF="#note12">12</A></SUP><p>

If we had quoted the Spanish (<B>spana</B>) name of Christopher Columbus, or the German (<B>dotca</B>) one, we could have used <B>sei</B> or <B>dei</B> because neither [say] nor [day] occur in it as well.

<P>Note that the argument <B>la Kristobal Kolo'n</B> designates a once-living person, while the arguments <B>Li, Kristobal Kolo'n, lu</B>; <B>Lie, Christopher y Columbus</B>; and <B>Lie, Cristobal y Colon'</B> all designate portions of human speech, namely a Loglan, an English, and a Spanish name. <B>Kristobal Kolon'</B>, 'Cristobal Colon'' and 'Christopher Columbus' are different names; but they name the same person, namely Cristobal Colo'n.</P>
<P>Weak quotation with <B>li</B> and <B>lu</B> is used much as ordinary quotation marks are used in written English. The chief difference is that in Loglan they are spoken words. In fact <B>li</B> and <B>lu</B> are used exactly as the words 'quote' and 'end quote' are used in certain styles of spoken English, especially the style that is invoked when the speaker wishes to be very certain that someone else's words are not mistaken for his own.<SUP><A HREF="#note13">13</A></SUP> In Loglan the motivation of the speaker's use of <B>li</B> and <B>lu</B> is logical, and hence less circumstantial. For there is a difference between the name of a thing and that thing. This difference is fundamental in a logical language. So quotation marks are never omitted in Loglan even when their presence might be thought to be assumed. Thus, of the two sentences,</P>

<P>only one is true if, as we assume, John is not a word of any length but a man. Here <B>liu</B> (a blend of <B>li</B> and <B>lu</B>) is the <EM>single word quotation</EM> operator and may always be translated 'The word '...''. <B>Liu</B> may only be used with confidence on Loglan words.<SUP><A HREF="#note14">14</A></SUP>  There is also a character quotation operator <B>lii</B> which converts letterals to names of letters:  <B>lii bei</B> means "b", where <B>liu bei</B> would mean "bei".</P>
<P>In spoken English all these clarifying marks are commonly left out. The usual form of the sentence which means (4) is spoken exactly as it would be spoken if the speaker had meant (5). We rely on the "good sense" of the listener <EM>not</EM> to infer that the speaker actually meant (5). Again, the interpretation of English depends on context. Loglan does not. In Loglan we wish to be able to speak nonsense when we want to.<SUP><A HREF="#note15">15</A></SUP> Thus (4) and (5) in Loglan are invariably distinct forms.</P>
<P>In some forms of written Loglan the words <B>li</B> and <B>lu</B> may be replaced by their signs '&laquo;' and '&raquo;'.<SUP><A HREF="#note16">16</A></SUP> So written, (1) becomes:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(6) &laquo;Kristobal Kolon&raquo; logla namci la Kristobal Kolon</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>But, as always, such signs are pronounced as words in speech.</P>
<P>Summarizing, there are three kinds of quotation words in Loglan: (i) ordinary or weak quotation with <B>li</B>...<B>lu</B>; (ii) single word quotation with <B>liu</B> (and character quotation with <B>lii</B>); and (iii) strong quotation with <B>lie</B>. <!-- When convenient <B>X</B> may be the letter word for the initial letter of the Loglan predicate for the language of the quoted string.--> Strong quotation can handle any kind of quoted string including nonsense and non-Loglan (with restrictions on the appearance of punctuation marks).</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.11">4.11</A> Abstract Description with <B>lopo lopu lozo</B></H2>


<P>We are now ready to deal with the abstract entities we left hanging in Chapter 3. You may recall that the abstract operators <B>po</B>, <B>pu</B> and <B>zo</B> which we discussed in that chapter permitted us to form predicate expressions like <B>pu gudbi</B> which meant '...is a property of being good', but that "goodness-in-general", or what we there called "virtue", was still beyond us at that time. But we are now ready for 'virtue'. Surprisingly, it is a mass term. For it is used exactly like the word 'butter' is used in English and evidently designates the mass individual manifested in all the particular instances of virtue that there are. Consequently, the Loglan designation that translates this word is made with the compound operator <B>lopu</B>, which is <B>lo</B> + <B>pu</B> and usually pronounced [loh-poo]; and 'virtue' in Loglan is <B>lopu gudbi</B> /lopuGUDbi/, or the mass composed of all the properties of anyone's or anything's being good that there are. Similarly, we would expect <B>lopo gudbi</B> to be used when the mass individual was to be composed of all the acts, states or events of goodness that there are, and to be best translated into English by 'goodness'. Finally, we would expect <B>lozo gudbi</B> to be used when the mass individual was to be composed of all the measurable quantities of goodness that there are, the latter being translatable by no English word or simple phrase because no such concept is readily available to speakers of English. To translate <B>lozo preda</B> we have to use a circumlocution...as I just have.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Note that some of the constructions we are now encountering are more complex in Loglan than they are in English. And rightly so. For the ideas that underlie them are in fact complex. Because they <EM>seem</EM> very simple in English, words like 'virtue', 'courage', 'weight', and 'length' are logically very troublesome to our English-thinking minds. Where are these individuals? What does it mean to "love" virtue, or to "have" weight? In Loglan it is plain that these individuals are complex creations of the human mind.<SUP><A HREF="#note17">17</A></SUP> To love <B>lopu gudbi</B> is to love a massive, discontinuous, widely distributed individual composed of all the instances of just that property by which all the phenomena that ever exhibit it may be said to be good. That is possible...in Loglan as well as in English. But in Loglan it is obvious that it is a very different enterprise than loving John.</P>
<P>On the other hand, some uses of abstract words in English obscure some very simple ideas. For example, to "have weight" is simply to weigh something, and no abstract entity is involved in doing that. Thus the abstract creature we call 'weight' is <B>lopu tidjo</B> in Loglan; for in more explicit English, weight is all the heaviness there is. But to say that X "has weight" is simply to say</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/daTIDjo/</CENTER></P>

<P>which doesn't involve abstraction at all. Thus the Loglan speaker is usually not inclined to speak in this unnecessarily abstract English way. Even so, da could translate such English expressions literally if da wished to. Here is one way to do it:</P>

<!-- .H4.12 SPECIFIED DESCRIPTION WITH JE JUE -->
<P>Talking abstractly about things that can be talked about concretely is not a very satisfactory procedure in any language. On the other hand people <EM>do</EM> have genuine attitudes toward abstract things, if only because the structure of their language tempts them to see the world in an abstract way. Thus to say</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/laDJAN.CLUvalopoSUCmi/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>is a perfectly sensible thing to do in English, though a curious one in Loglan. But presumably in both languages what John loves is just this abstract, massively distributed thing composed of all the events of swimming that there are. (Notice that we are now using the event-operator <B>po</B>.) But if what John really loves is <EM>his</EM> swimming, then in Loglan we would say so:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da cluva lopo da sucmi </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">He loves the mass of all events composed of his swimming.</TD></TR>

<P>In pidgin-style English, 'X love mass-event X swim.' Similarly, to love the color blue, as in</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(5)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da cluva lopu blanu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X loves blue.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/daCLUvalopuBLAnu/</CENTER></P>

<P>is easier to do in English than in Loglan. For the word 'blue' functions in such English sentences as if it were a proper name (e.g., 'X loves Mary'). But it is possible to love blue even in Loglan. It may be a little more troublesome to do so, for it is necessary to perform two distinct grammatical operations on the naked predicate <B>blanu</B> with which the Loglan mind begins. Even so, such designations can be formed.</P>
<P>We may expect, therefore, that our customary European attitudes toward abstract entities will survive in Loglan, but with a finer set of discriminations than we are used to in English. For if you're going to love virtue in Loglan you must first decide whether it is the mass of all goodnesses that you love, or all states of being good, or all quantities of goodness, or, a little more concretely, the mass of all good things.

<P>are your choices. For each might be said to be a legitimate translation of 'I love virtue' into Loglan. Again we see that Loglan embraces English but exceeds it, and in ways that will probably lead to greater awareness of the nature of abstraction than is usual among speakers of English. For if a thing is an abstract entity and not a concrete one, it will be obvious in Loglan that it is, and in just what ways. We suppose there will be some advantage in this arrangement for the thinker.<SUP><A HREF="#note18">18</A></SUP></P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.12">4.12</A> Specified Description with <B>je jue</B><SUP><A HREF = "#rnote5">R5</A></SUP></H2>


<P>We can now go back to deal with a matter that we left unsettled at the end of <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.8">Section 4.8</A>. In that section we dealt with particular descriptions formed with <B>le</B>, and we concluded by saying that any untensed and unspecified predicate expression of the language could be made the basis of a description with <B>le</B> without adjusting it in any way. Mass descriptions with <B>lo</B>, we later implied, could be constructed from predicates selected from the same broad domain. But now suppose we <EM>do</EM> want to form a description with a specified predicate, that is, with a predicate that has one or more of its arguments shown. Suppose, for example, we want to use the specified predicate <B>farfu la Rabrrt</B>, as it might occur in the sentence <B>Da farfu la Rabrrt</B> ('X is the father of Robert') as the basis of a description. That is, we wish to designate someone who is--or is locatable as--the father of Robert. What adjustment must we make, and why?</P>
<P>First let us see what happens if we try to describe the father of Robert in the usual way. Suppose we simply precede the predicate expression <B>farfu la Rabrrt</B> with <B>le</B> as follows:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Le farfu la Rabrrt </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">???</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/leFARfulaRabrrt/</CENTER>
</P>

<!-- .H4.12 SPECIFIED DESCRIPTION WITH JE JUE -->
<P>But what have we designated? Not one thing, but two. For if we now try to use the string we formed in (1) as an argument of some multi-place predicate, for example with the predicate <B>godzi</B> ('...goes to...from...') as below,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Da pa godzi le farfu la Rabrrt</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>/dapaGODzileFARfulaRabrrt/</CENTER>

<P>we then see that the single designation we thought we had formed breaks up immediately into two: <B>le farfu</B> and <B>la Rabrrt</B>. In (2) we <EM>hoped</EM> to say the X went to the father <EM>of</EM> Robert; instead what we actually said was that X went to the father <EM>from</EM> Robert. For Robert has changed allegiance. No longer is he the father's son; he is now the point of departure from which X went.</P>
<P>To avoid this kind of confusion, Loglan uses two little linking words to attach the arguments of specified descriptions to the main descriptive term. <B>Je</B> [zheh] is the first of these and links second arguments to descriptions. Thus what we failed to say in (2) we may now say by using <B>je</B>:</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dapaGODzileFARfujelaRabrrt/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>It is as if we had hyphenated the whole phrase. For <B>le farfu je la Rabrrt</B> now functions everywhere as a single term. To attach two specifying arguments to a description, we use <B>je</B> and the second linking operator <B>jue</B> [zhweh] as follows:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">

<CENTER>/dapaGODzileFARfujelaRabrrt.juelaMERis/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>and <B>je</B> and <B>jue</B> now hold the entire description <B>le farfu je la Rabrrt jue la Meris</B> together. And to attach three or more arguments to a description, we use <B>je</B> first, and then as many instances of <B>jue</B> as we require:</P>


<P>

</P>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>I have hyphenated the whole English phrase starting with 'the-seller-' and ending with '-dollars' to show that the Loglan construction is similarly linked by its <B>je</B>'s and <B>jue</B>'s into a single term. <B>Jue</B> is the general link for all arguments in third or higher places of a descriptive predicate. (The word <B>nema</B>, by the way, is a number word meaning 'one hundred'.)</P>
<P>Now a world of English ambiguities is avoided by this device. For though the number of English prepositions is very large, they do not work as effectively in keeping descriptive meanings straight as the pair of Loglan linking words <B>je</B> and <B>jue</B>.</P>
<P>For example, suppose I say in English 'I talked to the teacher of many things.' What do I mean? That we talked <EM>about</EM> many things? Or that the teacher taught many subjects? In English, one cannot be sure. In Loglan, one cannot be in doubt. The little word <B>ro</B> means 'many'; and the predicate <B>bekti</B> is the general word for 'thing'. The predicate <B>takna</B> means '...talks to...about...'. Therefore, the two possible interpretations of the English sentence can be said unequivocally in Loglan in these two ways:</P>

<P>(Both pauses are phrasing pauses.) The difference, of course, is the presence in (7), and the absence in (6), of the linking operator <B>je</B>. Accordingly, the phrase <B>le ditca ro bekti</B> in (6) represents <EM>two</EM> arguments, the second and third arguments respectively of the predicate <B>takna</B> ('...talks to...about...'). While in (7) the linked phrase <B>le ditca je ro bekti</B> ('the teacher <EM>of</EM> many things') functions as a <EM>single</EM> argument, namely as the second argument of that same predicate. What could be clearer? A little experimentation with the linking operators will show that they settle nearly all prepositional ambiguities of this kind. For example:</P>

<!-- .H4.13 EVENT DESCRIPTIONS WITH LEPO -->
<P>Here English 'from' does not succeed in distinguishing the two ways in which Rome is linked in these descriptions, despite the pause that we hopefully introduce in (9). In Loglan, however, the difference between <B>je</B> and <B>jue</B> clearly shows that <B>la Romas</B> is the second argument of <B>kamla</B> in (8), that is, a place of origin, and the third argument of <B>furvea</B> in (9), that is, the seller of whatever came. This is tricky...but in English, not in Loglan.</P>
<P>Incidentally, mass descriptions may also be specified. But to do so may severely limit the extent of their "massiveness". Thus, when unspecified, the description <B>lo farfu</B> designates a massive object with many parts (as in 'Fathers of the world unite'). But should we now specify the predicate <B>farfu</B>, as in <B>lo farfu je la Rabrrt</B>, we would find that the corporate entity we have now designated (as in 'Fathers of Robert unite') is exactly the same entity as the single person we might have designated with <B>le farfu je la Rabrrt</B>. But again it is a matter of biology, not grammar, that people have only one father. So the distinction between <B>le farfu je la Rabrrt</B> and <B>lo farfu je la Rabrrt</B> exists to tease the fancy, if not the factual mind.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.13">4.13</A> Event Descriptions with <B>lepo</B></H2>


<P>There is one variety of specified description that deserves and gets special treatment in Loglan. This is the specified abstract description formed with a compound operator made by joining any descriptive operator to <B>po</B>, <B>pu</B> or <B>zo</B>. The most widely used form of this construction is called <EM>event description</EM> and is made with the compound operator <B>lepo</B> (typically pronounced [leh-poh] with level stress), a word that may always be translated 'the event, state or condition of...'. Thus the unspecified description <B>lepo sucmi</B> means 'the particular event of swimming which I have in mind', or simply 'the swim'. Similarly, <B>lepo prano</B> means 'the run', and <B>lepo mrenu</B> means 'the manhood (of some particular person)'. Obviously we shall sometimes want to specify such predicates as richly as we can. For we shall often want to anticipate such questions as: Whose manhood? Who ran? And where did he run?</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Now the special treatment consists in this. Where the specification of concrete descriptions is limited to the second and higher order arguments of a predicate (<B>le farfu je la Djan</B>), the specification of abstract predicates may include the mention of first arguments as well. Thus we say</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/lepolaDJAN.paTRAcila.esPANias.laFRANS/</CENTER></P>

<P>We now observe that the constructions which form the basis of these descriptions are not simply predicate expressions, but whole sentences: <B>Da sucmi</B>; <B>Da mrenu</B>; <B>Da prano de di</B>; and <B>La Djan, pa traci la Espanias, la Frans</B>. Obviously this is a very flexible form. Notice something else. The specified arguments in (3) and (4) evidently do <EM>not</EM> require the linking operators <B>je</B> and <B>jue</B> which we learned to use in specifying descriptions in the previous section. Why is this?</P>
<P>The reason is that event descriptions are formed, not with predicate expressions, but with what we may usefully think of as whole sentences. The sentence may be incomplete, even totally without arguments, as in <B>lepo sucmi</B>, or it may be complete with all possible arguments mentioned, as in <B>lepo da sucmi de di do</B> ('the event of X's swimming to Y from Z by route W'); but any sentence whatever may be used to form an event description with the phrase <B>lepo</B>. Special punctuation rules we will study later guard this construction against ambiguity.<SUP><A HREF="#note19">19</A></SUP></P>
<P>We sense immediately how convenient this new form is. For we now have a form in which any conceivable event, state or condition, whether actual or imaginary, may be easily designated simply by preceding any sentence which asserts it with the phrase <B>lepo</B>. One consequence of this way of designating events is that imaginary states of affairs may be designated without asserting their existence. Thus with event descriptions we can talk about the events which people fear, hope or expect, or the states of affairs in which they believe, whether these events or states are ever realized or not. As usual we can do so in a more straightforward way than is possible in English.</P>
<!-- .H4.14 THE PREDICATE MARKER GA -->
<P>In English we say 'John believes that it will rain.' But what is it in which John believes? English grammarians call this kind of thing "indirect discourse", suggesting that there is a sentence somewhere which the speaker does not bother to quote directly but in the truth of which da is saying John believes. But this is not a very satisfactory account of the meaning of this clause. Suppose there <EM>is</EM> no sentence. Suppose John goes to the window, looks at the sky, gets his raincoat, and goes out. Observing this, <EM>we</EM> may say with some confidence 'John believes that it will rain.' But the object we are designating with the phrase 'that it will rain' is certainly not discourse of any kind.</P>

<H2><A NAME="sec4.14">4.14</A> The Predicate Marker <B>ga</B></H2>


<P>We now consider what happens to a description when it occupies the first place of an unadorned predicate. For example, suppose we wish to say that some particular wise person is a man in the same time-free sense that we already know how to say that X is a man, namely</P>

<P>Does this mean what we intend? Or does it mean 'the wise man', which is not a sentence at all (it claims nothing) but a more elaborate description? Obviously the expression <B>Le sadji mrenu</B> will be interpreted as a description no matter what we intend. It is clear that we have uncovered a major source of ambiguity were no special provision made to prevent such--evidently futile--intentions from arising. That special rule is that whenever a predicate word is the last word to appear before an unadorned predicate expression, then we use the marker word <B>ga</B> in the position of the tense operator to mark the point at which the description ends and the predicate expression begins:</P>

<P>We can now consider several other varieties of description.

Suppose we <EM>do</EM> want to add a time particular to some description, as in 'the present king of England'. Can we do this in Loglan? Of course; but it turns out to be more parsimonious, grammatically, to generate a set of tensed descriptors--such as <B>lena</B> [leh-nah] ('the present'), <B>lepa</B> [leh-pah] ('the-former') and <B>lefa</B> [leh-fah] ('the-future')--to do this work, rather than permitting tense operators to occur within descriptively used predicates.

<P>Notice that when a stressed syllable precedes a predicate word it must be separated from the predicate by a pause. As noted in Chapter 2, this is a general rule. No stressed syllable may pauselessly precede a predicate.</P>
<P>Perhaps more important for translating English than the <EM>tensed</EM> descriptors, however, are the spatially particularized descriptors formed with <B>vi</B> and <B>va</B>. As we saw in the chapter on predicates, these two little words mean 'here' and 'there', and are used in many ways as tense operators are used in Loglan. Like tense operators, they may be combined with either <B>le</B> or <B>lo</B> to form just those demonstrative descriptions which we would translate into English with 'this' and 'that', as in the sentences below:</P>

</P>

<P>The distinction between <B>lovi cutri</B> and <B>levi cutri</B> ('the mass of all the water here' and 'this particular puddle of water here') will not seem immediately useful to the English mind. For the noun 'water' seems incorrigibly masslike in English and the adjective 'this' in the phrase 'this water' does little to particularize it. But the Loglan mind starts with integral bits and pieces of water and will therefore be tempted to use <B>lo cutri</B> and <B>lovi cutri</B> only when some synthesis of these elementary bits and pieces is intended. In short, to use this apparatus intelligently we shall have to think about the distinction between <B>le</B> and <B>lo</B> in a Loglan way.<SUP><A HREF="#note23">23</A></SUP> The distinction between these operators arises, of course, from the fact that every Loglan predicate is a general term. Thus while the Loglan mind starts with pieces of water and bits of better-than, it can be carried by abstraction and mass description to whatever lofty abstractions of "waterness" and virtue we Indo-European thinkers might require. And by the operations of specifying predicates, or tensing them or locating them, we can stop anywhere we like along the way. Thus with <B>lovi cutri</B> we pause to glance at the local mass of water on our way.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.16">4.16</A> Possessive Description with <B>lemi letu leda</B></H2>


<P>The mechanism of "possession" in language ('my hat', 'your mother', 'John's book', etc.) is a widely misunderstood phenomenon. It is unfortunate that the grammarians who first studied it called it "possession", for usually the relationship it specifies has nothing to do with possessing things at all. Thus, in English I can talk of my son's clothes (which he doesn't really own any more than I own him), of your mother (whom you certainly don't own), of my skin (which is simply attached to me) or even of his corner of the room (which is where he is). Thus a huge variety of predicate relations is evidently hidden in these slippery little "possessive" words.</P>
<!-- .H4.16 POSSESSIVE DESCRIPTION -->
<P>Even so, if we are to translate from the natural languages, we need the "possessive" descriptors, for they provide a useful kind of brevity. But let us be clear about what they are abbreviations of. If you think about it, you will see that when you say 'my hat' you are designating it; and you are doing so by implying that it is a hat that is related in some way to you. You may have several, but this is the one you mean. Moreover, your designation is a description. It utilizes the predicate 'is a hat' in a perfectly regular way. It also uses another fact about that hat in a second but implicit description, namely that it is related somehow to you. Probably the essence of your relation to your hat is that you are the only one who uses it. But whatever that relation is, it is not explicitly predicated in your designation 'my hat'. Thus you have used <EM>two</EM> properties of your hat to describe it: one explicitly (that it's a hat), the other implicitly (that it is related somehow--you haven't said how--to you).</P>
<P>In English none of this is clear. It can be found out by analysis, of course, for we have found it out in English. But the semantic structure of the English possessive pronouns cannot be seen either in their word forms or in their grammatical inflections in that language. Here is a sentence with a Loglan possessive form:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Lemi bukcu ga blanu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">My book is blue.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/lemiBUKcugaBLAnu/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>The first thing we make clear is that the expression <B>lemi bukcu</B> <EM>is</EM> a description ('the-me book'). For it involves the descriptive operator <B>le</B> in a most obvious way. Secondly, by using <B>bukcu</B> in <B>lemi bukcu</B> just as we use it in <B>le bukcu</B>, we also make clear that the predicate <B>bukcu</B> is the basis of this description, too. Whatever additional properties it may have, the thing we intend you to look for is at least a book. Thirdly, the auxiliary role of the word <B>mi</B> in the descriptive operator <B>lemi</B> suggests to the listener--on the model of <B>levi</B> and <B>lena</B>--that an abbreviation of something else is afoot. It is. That something else is that I am related somehow to the designated thing. Thus, look for it in <EM>my</EM> hand, on <EM>my</EM> desk, or where <EM>I</EM> left it. And that is all. You must not expect me to furnish the deed.<SUP><A HREF="#note24">24</A></SUP></P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/le<EM>MI</EM>meda.GUDbile<EM>TU</EM>mede/</CENTER>
</P>


<P>In sentence (5) a curious thing happens. A possessive description has been formed, not with a predicate, but with a variable in the usual place of the predicate (<B>da</B> in <B>lemi meda</B>). What this means is that the explicit portion of the possessive description has been omitted, and we are left with its implicit portion only: namely that I am referring to some X that is related in some way to me. This is, of course, exactly what we mean by 'mine'.  The little word <B>me</B>, as we will see later, serves to convert a description to a predicate.</P>
<P>Now you have probably sensed that the utility of the possessive form lies not only in its economy but in its vagueness. For it is not only simpler to say 'my hat' than 'the hat which I regularly use' in both English and Loglan (<B>lemi kapma</B> as opposed to <B>le kapma ce nu plizo je mi</B> = 'the thing which is a hat and used by me'), but just as in English, the very vagueness of the unspecified relation is sometimes useful. Suppose I don't know how Johnny is related to the car I see him driving (it is probably <EM>owned</EM> by his father). When I call it <B>le la Djanis, tcaro</B> ('the-Johnny car') I avoid committing myself on this delicate matter. But suppose there is no doubt about the relationship which I want to impute. Suppose I am talking about his mother. Do I say <B>le la Djanis, matma</B> in Loglan?</P>
<P>I <EM>may</EM> do so if I wish; but it is an unnecessary circumlocution for what can easily be said directly, in Loglan. For <B>le matma je la Djanis</B> ('the mother of Johnny') provides what will almost always be a better designation in Loglan of Johnny's mother, that is, a more useful one, than <B>le la Djanis, matma</B> is. For <B>le matma je la Djanis</B> is a specified description which relates Johnny as an offspring to his mother: a much more exact relation than "possession". Similarly, the predicates for body-parts are all two-place predicates in Loglan. It is therefore unnecessarily vague to say <B>lemi barma</B> ('the-me arm') when you can say <B>le barma je mi</B> much more explicitly. One is not related to one's arm vaguely, at least not in Loglan.</P>
<!-- .H4.18 PREDICATE NAMES -->
<P>Mass descriptions may also be possessive in Loglan. Thus <B>lo resfu</B> means 'clothing in general' (<B>resfu</B> = 'is a garment, an article of clothing'), whereas <B>lomi resfu</B> means 'my clothing'. This is another momentary specialization of a mass term--or partial massification of a general term, as we might now prefer to say--which is similar in mood and structure to the located mass term <B>lovi cutri</B>. Thus semantic parallels often exist between one grammatical construction and another in Loglan, and these are usually reflected in their having similar structures in a Loglan-viewed reality.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.17">4.17</A> Possession with <B>pe</B></H2>


<P>The possessive form <B>le la Kristobal Kolo'n, botsu</B> ('Christopher Columbus's boat') is as clumsy an expression in Loglan as it is in English. A simple operation exists to reverse these terms...in both languages:</P>

But <B>pe</B> [peh] is a kind of vague, all-purpose linking marker saying only that he's related in <EM>some</EM> way to his boat: that he owns it, sails around on it, goes to sea in it, is its captain or its cabin-boy.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>But now suppose that we wish to talk of that man's boat. 'That man' is easy enough; it is <B>leva mrenu</B>. But if we put <B>leva mrenu</B> in the position of <B>la Djan</B> in <B>le la Djan botsu</B>, we encounter a difficulty. For <B>*le leva mrenu botsu</B> seems to say 'the that man type of boat', which says nothing at all in Loglan. Obviously we need to terminate the internal description <B>leva mrenu</B> with some kind of marker. We may do so with the comma-word <B>gu</B> [goo], and <B>gu</B> may or may not be accompanied by a pause.</P>

<P>But we may feel that this, too, is clumsy, especially if we want to say more about the man. So we might prefer the inverse possessive forms with <B>pe</B>:</P>

<P>Thus <B>pe</B> is used most effectively when the speaker wishes to designate the "possessor" with a longer and more elaborate construction than da plans for the "possessed."</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.18">4.18</A> Predicate Names</H2>


<P>A maneuver that looks like description but is not is to use the name operator <B>la</B> to turn a predicate or predicate expression into a name. The predicates used for this purpose are always predicates that may be used as calls, that is, to call the attention of someone, just as we may use the predicate 'father' to call 'Father!' in English. We will learn how to make attention-calling expressions of this kind (vocatives) in the next chapter. But in this one we are concerned with how predicate names may be used to talk about the people whose attention may be called with them.</P>
<P>In English we express our intention to make a name out of a predicate by dropping the article and capitalizing its initial letter when we use it in writing. 'Father', we say or write, 'got back last night.' In Loglan we accomplish this same purpose by using the name operator <B>la</B> in both speech and text and capitalizing the predicate word or words in text:</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/laFARfu.<!--added pause-->paFAVgoi.nalepaziNATli/</CENTER>
</P>

<!-- .H4.19 NAMES FROM PREDICATES -->
<P>(<B>Pazi</B> means 'just preceding', so <B>lepazi natli</B> means 'the-just-past night'. There will be more on this kind of maneuver in Chapter 5.) How different this is from the same sentence with the ordinary descriptor <B>le</B>:</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/leFARfupaFAVgoi.nalepaziNATli/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Sentence (1) suggests that the speaker is one of the father's offspring, or at least a member of his household...one of the few people, at any rate, who are entitled to call him by that name. Sentence (2), in contrast, suggests that the speaker is a detached observer, perhaps a detective staked-out in front of the Jones house, say, who is reporting that the father of the family has returned.</P>
<P>In general, to use a predicate as a name rather than as a description connotes familiarity, even intimacy: the intimacy reserved for those who have the right to use such words as names. 'Father', 'Mother', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Husband', 'Darling', 'Sister', 'Brother', 'Son', 'Fatty', 'Boy', 'Big Guy', and so on, are among the numerous English predicates that turn up as names in that language.</P>
<P>The intimacy effect of using predicate names is often exploited by tellers of children's stories.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) Rat told Dog he was going fishing with Cat. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>'(To) tell' is to '(to) knowledge-give' in Loglan; so this word is <B>djadou</B> [jah-DOH-oo] from <B>djano donsu</B>. '(To) go fishing with' is '(to) fish-hunt-accompany'; so this one is <B>ficyjankii</B> [feesh-uh-zhan-KEE-ee] from <B>ficli janto kinci</B>. The predicates for 'rat', 'dog' and 'cat' are <B>ratcu</B>, <B>kangu</B> and <B>katma</B>, respectively. So this line could go into a Loglan children's story as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(3') La Ratcu,<!--added comma--> pa djadou la Kangu lepo de fa ficyjankii la Katma</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>/laRATcu.padjaDOulaKANgu.lepodefaficyjanKIilaKATma/</CENTER>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>With these examples I have let us get slightly ahead of our grammar. We do not really know how to make three-term complexes like <B>ficyjankii</B> ('fish-hunt-with') or modifying phrases like <B>na lepazi natli</B> ('in the-just-past night'), or how and when to use them. These topics will be treated in the next chapter, which is on the structure of utterances. But in the next section we will consider how we can make shorter names for use in such stories once we do know how to write them.</P>
<P>We are still concerned, in short, with the ingredients of utterances rather than their structure.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.19">4.19</A> Names from Predicates and Little Words</H2>


<P>A name in Loglan is any consonant-final word. Therefore a very natural way of making names is to drop the final vowel or vowels from a predicate word, getting <B>Mren</B> from <B>mrenu</B>, for example, or to add a final consonant to a little word, getting <B>Tun</B> from <B>tu</B>. We may call the names made in these ways <EM>internal names</EM> because they come from inside the language. Most Loglan names, of course, are borrowed.</P>
<P>For example, The Institute has a dog named <B>Cimrr</B> [SHEE-mrr] and it once had a cat named <B>Gro'katmm</B> [GROH-kah-tmm]. The name <B>Cimr</B> was made from the predicate <B>cimra</B> [SHEEM-rah], which means 'summer' and fits the sunny temperament of its referent. The predicate <B>grokatma</B> [groh-KAHT-mah], which means 'big-cat', was the source of <B>Gro'katm</B>...with its abnormal and therefore marked stress, notice. <B>Grokatma</B>, from <B>groda katma</B>, was a complex derived on the spot for that monstrous cat.</P>
<P><B>Tun</B> itself is an excellent example of an internal name made from a little word. It is the name of You, or of whatever person the speaker can get the attention of by shouting it. Spoken like 'You, there!' into a crowd of inert bystanders, <B>Tun</B> is the temporary name of whoever will respond. We'll see in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.27">Section 4.27</A> how numerical names, like <B>Ten</B> and <B>Fon</B> ('Three' and 'Four') may also be made by the consonant-adding route. Conventionally, the consonant that is always added to make little word names is <B>n</B>. </P>
<P>All the predicate names in the last section could have been made as calls first by the vowel-dropping route. Thus, <B>la Farfu</B> could have been <B>la Farf</B> or <B>la Far</B>, 'Mom' could be <B>Mat</B> or <B>Matmm</B> ([MAH-tmm] to rhyme with <B>Gro'katm</B>), and the name of the personage called Rat in the children's story could have been rendered with either Loglan <B>Rat</B> [raht] or <B>Ratc</B> [rahtch] as the writer preferred. Similarly, the character of Dog could have been Loglan <B>Kan</B> or <B>Kang</B> [kahngg], with the hard [g] after [ng] definitely pronounced, and Cat could have been Loglan <B>Kat</B> [kaht] or <B>Katmm</B>, again as the writer preferred.</P>
<!-- .H4.21 NUMBERS -->
 Indeed, using a predicate as a name is a rather formal thing to do, just as 'Father' is formal in English. But dropping a vowel, or a vowel and a consonant, from the same predicates is an informal, even familiar move. It yields <B>Mat</B> and <B>Far</B>, which, like 'Mom' and 'Dad', amount to nicknames. So with Loglan words like <B>Rat</B>, <B>Kan</B>, <B>Kat</B>, <B>Fum</B>, <B>Mat</B> and <B>Far</B> we enter the affectionate world of nicknames.



<H2><A NAME="sec4.20">4.20</A> Set Description with <B>loe leu lea</B></H2>


<P>There are three other little words that have grammatical distributions which are identical to that of <B>le</B> and <B>lo</B>, and these are the set descriptors <B>loe leu lea</B> [loh-eh, leigh-oo, leigh-ah]. Each has a special variety of 'the' to convey that lends precision to description in Loglan. Each involves sets in some way. In the following discussion we will use the Loglan word <B>preda</B> to stand for any Loglan predicate expression and the English nonce word 'preda' for its translation into English as a common noun.</P>

<P><B>Loe preda</B> designates the characteristic or typical individual preda which best exemplifies the set of predas in the given context. At bottom this is a statistical construct. For instance,</P>


<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Loe femdi cimpanizi [sheem-pah-NEE-zee] ga forli loe mendi ce humni atlete</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">The (typical) female chimpanzee is stronger than the typical) male human athlete.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/loeFEMdicimpaNIzi.gaFORliloeMENdiceHUMni.atLEte/</CENTER></P>


<P>would require the mounting of a fairly extensive experimental enterprise in order to confirm or refute it. Indeed, (1) might be the conclusion of such an investigation, or a result remembered from reading about one.</P>
<P>In English we would usually say 'The chimpanzee female is stronger than the human male athlete' and leave the listener to figure out what sensible thing we might have meant. In Loglan we must do better than that. We make such statements more precise by using <B>loe</B>, a special kind of 'the' in which the notion of typicality is built in.</P>

<P><B>Leu preda</B> designates the set of predas--not the individual predas, note, but the particular set--which the speaker has in mind. It means 'the set of some (predas)'.</P>


<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Leu monca gorla ga cmalo [SHMAH-loh]</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%"> The (set of) mountain gorillas (I have in mind) are few (literally, is small).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/leuMONcaGORlagaCMAlo/</CENTER>
</P>


<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Like <B>le</B>-designations, <B>leu</B>-designations are intentional. That is, they designate whatever set the speaker intends to designate with da's description. But unlike <B>le</B>-designata--the things that <B>le-</B>phrases designate--<B>leu</B>-designata are sets, not individuals. Thus, we may compare their properties with those of other sets, for example, in size, diversity, longevity, and so on. Certainly the speaker of (2) does not mean that any particular mountain gorilla is small, much less that all of them are, as <B>Ra monca gorla ga cmalo</B> ('All mountain gorillas are small') would claim. The universal quantifier <B>ra</B> will be taken up in Sections 4.23 and 4.24.</P>

<P><B>Lea preda</B> designates, for any preda, the non-empty set of all the predas. It is universal, not intentional. Like <B>leu</B>, its designatum is always a set, not the members of some set. Unlike <B>leu</B>, it means 'the set of all (predas)'.</P>

<CENTER>/leaFICligaLALdole,aMAMla/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Certainly we would not mean to claim by this English sentence that every fish is older than every mammal, or even that any individual fish is. We could only sensibly mean that the non-empty set of fishes has endured longer, i.e., has had members in it longer (on this planet, anyway), than the non-empty set of mammals.</P>
<P>In Loglan we wish to make these ideas clear.<SUP><A HREF="#note25">25</A></SUP></P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.21">4.21</A> Numbers</H2>


<P>One of the cleverer things we do with language is to apply numbers to arguments. Thus when I say in English 'Those ten men are teachers' I have said something that is strictly equivalent to looking at each of them in turn and saying 'That man is a teacher' ten times. But this is not the only way in which numbers may be used. Numerical concepts may also occur as predicates (for example 'We are three', 'It was a football eleven', 'He was first in line'), as proper nouns ('The number three', 'The year 1937'), and also as indefinite descriptors ('I saw three men', 'One of the teachers smoked'). We will provide for all these uses in due course. But we must first supply the basic number words themselves. Here are the digits from zero to nine:</P>

</TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<!-- .H4.22 QUANTIFIED ARGUMENTS -->
<P>There are some obvious regularities. First, note that the digits are divided into five pairs and that each pair has a characteristic consonant: <B>n t f s v</B>. Second, note that the odd-numbered member of each pair (<B>ne</B>, <B>te</B>, <B>fe</B>, <B>se</B> and <B>ve</B>) ends with <B>e</B>. Third, note that all the even-numbered digits except <B>ni</B>, that is, <B>to</B>, <B>fo</B>, <B>so</B> and <B>vo</B>, end with <B>o</B>. The word <B>ni</B> (zero) is evidently the one irregular word in the system. But this makes sense. Zero is the sign of the re-cycling of the system with every tenth member and so ought to be different. Thus 'ten' is <B>neni</B> (10), 'twenty' is <B>toni</B> (20), 'thirty' is <B>teni</B> (30) and so on; but 'twelve' is simply <B>neto</B> (12) and 'one-hundred-and-twenty-three' is simply <B>netote</B> (123).<SUP><A HREF="#note26">26</A></SUP></P>
<P>For larger numbers there are two extra "zeros", as we might call them: <B>ma</B> (<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-ma.GIF" ALT="zero with slash" HSPACE="1">) which represents multiplication by a hundred, or the double zero ('00') in English; and <B>moa</B> (<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1">) which represents multiplication by a thousand, or the English triple zero ('000'), which may be suffixed with a digit to indicate how many triple zeroes are to be appended. Thus 'one-hundred' is <B>nema</B> (1<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-ma.GIF" ALT="zero with slash" HSPACE="1">) in Loglan, 'a thousand' is <B>nemoa</B> (1<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1">), 'two-thousand' is <B>tomoa</B> (2<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1">), 'twenty-thousand' is <B>tonimoa</B> (20<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1">), 'two-hundred-thousand' is <B>tomamoa</B> (2<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-ma.GIF" ALT="zero with slash" HSPACE="1"><IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1">), 'two million' is <B>tomoamoa</B> or <B>tomoato</B> (2<IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1"><IMG SRC="glyph-loglan-mo.GIF" ALT="zero with strike-through" HSPACE="1">), and so on. Normally, compound number words, like compound little words generally, receive level stress. Thus [toh-mah-moa-HOOM-nee] and [veh-moa-moa-HOOM-nee] are the usual pronunciations of the Loglan phrases corresponding to 'two-hundred-thousand humans' (<B>tomamoa humni</B>) and 'nine-million humans' (<B>vemoamoa humni</B>), respectively, in which there are no pauses and in which only the penultimate syllable of the predicate word is stressed. On the other hand, any syllable in a number word may be emphasized to mark contrast: [<EM>TEH</EM>-veh-moa-moa-KAHT-mah] '<EM>thirty</EM>-nine-million cats'. Such emphasis is often shown by underlining the emphasized syllable in text: <B><U>tev</U>emoamoa katma</B>.</P>
<P>To round out the number system, the little word <B>pi</B> represents the decimal point, so that 'point-five' is <B>pife</B> (.<B>5</B>) and 'twelve and thirty-four hundredths' is simply the compound word <B>netopitefo</B> [neh-toh-pee-teh-foh] (<B>12.34</B>). Similarly, there is a set of arithmetic operators of which <B>kua</B> [kwah] ('divided by'), <B>tia</B> [tyah] ('multiplied by'), <B>piu</B> [pyoo] ('plus'), <B>niu</B> [nyoo] ('less'), <B>pea</B> [peigh-ah] ('positive') and <B>nea</B> [neigh-ah] ('negative') are the most useful. (The complete set of mathematical operators will be found in <B>Loglan 6</B>.) So <B>nekuato</B> [neh-kwah- toh] (<B>1/2</B>) is 'one-half'. What could be simpler? Let us now consider the uses of these number-words as argument quantifiers.<SUP><A HREF="#rnote6">R6</A></SUP></P>


<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->

<H2><A NAME="sec4.22">4.22</A> Quantified Arguments</H2>


<P>Quantification is the art of applying numbers to arguments. Sentences with quantified arguments, or, as we shall sometimes call them, plural sentences, are equivalent in meaning to those same sentences without quantified arguments (singular sentences) repeated n times; and the number of repetitions n is always equal to the product of the numbers used as quantifiers in the original sentence. Thus if I say:</P>


<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Levi to fumna ga corta leva ne mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">These two women are both shorter than that one man.</P></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
 


<P>what I have said is equivalent in meaning to the singular sentence,</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Levi fumna ga corta leva mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">This woman is shorter than that man.</P></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
 

<P>spoken twice. But if I say</P>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(3)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Levi to fumna ga corta leva <EM>te</EM> mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">These two women are (all) shorter than (each of) these <EM>three</EM> men.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>then what I have said is equivalent to speaking sentence (2) <EM>six</EM> times.</P>
<P>There are several things to notice about this. First, there is evidently no plural form of the Loglan descriptors <B>levi</B> and <B>leva</B>, and no plural inflection of the Loglan predicate. For with <B>levi to fumna</B> we are evidently not literally saying 'these two women', but '<EM>this</EM> two <EM>woman</EM>'. Again, Loglan sounds like pidgin. There is a logical advantage as well as an obvious simplicity in this grammatical plan. For it reveals more clearly than English does what the claim of such plural sentences is about. For note that the equivalently repeated sentence--sentence (2) above--is identical to both (1) and (3) except for the presence in the latter two of the number words. Second, the meaning of the Loglan quantifier evidently includes the meaning of such occasional clarifying phrases in English as 'each of', 'all', 'both', and so on. We will see why this is so in a moment. Finally, note that the two things designated by the quantifying phrase <B>levi to</B> in (1) and (3) are <EM>definitely</EM> designated. For suppose I had said:</P>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><EM>To</EM> levi fumna ga corta <EM>ne</EM> leva mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Two of these women are shorter than one of those men.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(5)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><EM>To</EM> levi fumna ga corta <EM>te</EM> leva mrenu </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Two of these women are shorter than (some) three of those men.</P></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<!-- .H4.22 QUANTIFIED ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Notice that if <EM>any</EM> two of the women designated in (4) are each shorter than some one of those men, then (4) is true. And if there exists a pair of women and a trio of men belonging to the two sets designated in (5), such that each woman of the pair is shorter than each man of the trio, then that sentence is true. We will have a look at the mechanism of indefinite quantification more closely in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.24">Section 4.24</A> on indefinite description.</P>
<P>Just as in English, the <EM>indefinite quantification</EM> of an argument may be freely alternated with its <EM>definite quantification</EM>. Thus, the following forms are all possible.</P>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(6)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Le te fumna </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(Each of) The (set of) three women (I have in mind).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(7)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><EM>Te</EM> le fumna </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(Some) <EM>Three</EM> of the (set of) women (I have in mind).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(8)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><EM>To</EM> le te fumna </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(Some) <EM>Two</EM> of the (set of) three women.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(9)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Le to le fumna </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(Each of) The (subset of) two of the (set of) women.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(10)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Le to le te fumna </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(Each of) The (subset of) two of the (set of) three women.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>And so on. Note that in these sentences <B>le</B> has the sense of the English phrase 'the set of', whether we are then told how many members the set has (as in <B>Le te fumna</B>), or not (as in <B>To le fumna</B>). Thus when we say <B>To le fumna</B> it is assumed that there are enough women in the set to yield at least two. Again we need no plural inflection of the predicate word to make this idea clear.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>So far we have been concerned with quantifications of descriptions made with the particular descriptive operators <B>le</B>, <B>levi</B> and <B>leva</B>. But now let us consider the effects of quantifying descriptions made with the mass operator <B>lo</B>. As usual, we will approach our problem obliquely by first considering an English ambiguity. Suppose I tell you:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(11) The two men carried that log.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The question immediately arises: Together? Or separately? It makes a difference. For if I mean that a <EM>team</EM> of two men has carried that log, I have asserted only one thing, namely that a single individual thing--albeit two-headed--carried that log. But if there had been a log-carrying contest, say, and each of two men succeeded in carrying that particular log, then I am, in effect, asserting two things when I say "they" carried it. Namely, that one of them did, and that the other of them did, too, presumably on different occasions.</P>
<P>Now the second of these interpretations is, as we have seen, exactly the meaning of the Loglan quantification with <B>le</B>. Thus,</P>

<P>expresses the notion of two successful occasions exactly. For this is indeed the sentence form that is equivalent to itself without <B>to</B> spoken two times.

</P>

<P>This parallel use of <B>le</B> and <B>lo</B> with quantifiers completely avoids the major source of ambiguity in the use of numbers in English. Suppose we say 'The two men went to London.' Did they go as a group, or separately? The English sentence doesn't say. 'The four women played bridge.' Are you saying four things? Or only one? The English sentence doesn't say, though in this case, we would usually guess from context that the best Loglan translation was to be made with <B>lo</B>.</P>
<!-- .H4.23 NON-NUMERICAL QUANTIFIERS -->
<P>Thus whenever a number of individuals are involved in such a way that they function together as a group, then the Loglan translation will usually be made with <B>lo</B>. But wherever sets of individuals are involved in such a way that we have something to say about each individual member of the set, then the Loglan designation will usually be made with <B>le</B>. The ambiguity of the English quantified form 'The two men carried it' can of course be resolved in English by the use of such qualifying phrases as 'each of', 'separately', 'together', 'as a group', and so on. But such maneuvers are not necessary in order to speak clearly in Loglan. Thus <B>le to mrenu</B> means 'each of the two men' without further qualification, and <B>lo to mrenu</B> means 'the two-man group' and not really 'the two men' at all. Again we find that Loglan makes a logical distinction clearly and explicitly that is implicit in English, but obscurely and irregularly handled in that language.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.23">4.23</A> Non-Numerical Quantifiers</H2>


<P>The Loglan words meaning 'all', 'some', 'many', and the like are used grammatically in exactly the same ways that the Loglan numerical quantifiers are used. Eight of these non-numerical quantifiers are presently defined:</P>

<P>The five <B>r</B>-words may be used in place of numbers, but they may not be used next to a number word. Thus one does not say 'All three of the men' in Loglan (*<B>Ra te le mrenu</B>)<SUP><A HREF="#rnote7">R7</A></SUP>, simply because <B>Te le mrenu</B> already means all of some three of the men. Similarly <B>Ra le te mrenu</B> ('All of the three men') is acceptable but redundant because <B>Le te mrenu</B> already means 'Each of the three men'. So the quantifier <B>ra</B> does not often accompany Loglan descriptions, being implicitly present in nearly all of them. But <B>Ri le se mrenu</B> ('Several of the seven men'), <B>Lo ro mrenu</B> ('The mass individual composed of many men'), and <B>Re le ro mrenu</B> ('Most of the many men'), are all useful forms. On the other hand, each of the three <B>s</B>-words <B>sa</B>, <B>su</B> and <B>si</B> may be usefully prefixed to numbers. When they are, they become part of a compound number word, as in the following sentences:</P>

<P>But <B>sa</B>, <B>su</B> and <B>si</B> may also be used like <B>r</B>-words in place of numbers. When they are used alone in this way, they are always abbreviations of longer expressions.

<!-- .H4.24 INDEFINITE DESCRIPTION -->
<P>But when these same words are used with mass descriptions, they must be prefixed by <B>pi</B>- to turn them into fractional quantifiers. In this form they mean 'much' and 'a little':</P>

<P>You will encounter no particular difficulty in understanding constructions made with the non-numerical quantifiers. And constructing them is scarcely more difficult.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.24">4.24</A> Indefinite Description</H2>


<P>Indefinite descriptions are made in Loglan by putting either a numerical or a non-numerical quantifier in front of a predicate expression. No other descriptive operator is involved. For example, <B>Ne mrenu</B> = 'One man', as in</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ne mrenu pa kamla </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(Exactly) One man came.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/neMREnupaKAMla/</CENTER></P>

<P>is such an indefinite description. What descriptions of this sort usually do, in both languages, is tell the listener that the described individuals are hard to find. This is a useful move for the speaker to make when information about how to locate them would be difficult or impossible to provide. In languages like English which have "indefinite articles" ('a' and 'an')--not all do; for example Russian doesn't--those articles are always among the words used to form its indefinite descriptions; but these always include the number words and certain other quantifiers like English 'all' and 'some' as well. To the best of my knowledge, all languages have indefinite descriptions of some kind.</P>
<P>A typical English use of indefinite description is in the sentence 'I just now saw one man in the street' as this might be spoken by someone looking out a window. The observer is apparently quite definite about da's seeing what da takes to be a man. Da is also definite about the number of men da sees: exactly one. But we may infer from da's choice of the indefinite form 'one man' over the definite form 'the man' that da is quite unable to identify the man da has just seen. Da could not, we feel confident, give us the address of that man, or his name, or indeed any other locating details. So by the usual rules of the designating game, no designation is really going on here. There is quantification (the number 'one') and there is description (the predicate 'man'). But there is no designation. The speaker is evidently quite unable (or unwilling...it amounts to the same thing) to help the listener locate the individual this sentence is about. It is for this reason that we call such structures <EM>indefinite</EM> descriptions. They describe but do not designate.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>In Loglan we form indefinite descriptions in exactly the same way as English does:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Mi pazi vizka ne mrenu le trida </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">I just saw exactly one man in (i.e., against the background of) the street.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/mipaziVIZkaneMREnuleTRIda/</CENTER></P>

<P>The reader may perhaps remember from Chapter 3 that to see something in Loglan is to relate the seer, the seen thing, and the background against which it is seen.</P>
<P>Any quantifier may be used as an indefinite descriptor:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(3)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Su sagro smabru pa hijri </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">A(t least one) cigar smoker (smoke-breather) was here.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/suSAGroSMAbrupaHIJri/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Cigar smoke in the room, perhaps? Another way of translating <B>su</B> in (3) would be to say 'Some cigar smokers were here.' In Loglan we might even prefer to use a mass-term and say <B>Lo sagro smabru pa hijri</B> ('Cigar-smokers were here'). The next sentence is more specific:</P>

<P>
<!-- Note: Paper ed had "A(t least)". I fixed the obvious typo. -->
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Sune<EM>ma</EM> sagro smabru pa hijri </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">(At least) a <EM>hundred</EM> cigar smokers were here.</TD></TR>

</P>

<P>Lots of cigar smoke, obviously...or a speaker given to exaggeration.</P>
<P>Finally, we come to that most mysterious of all indefinite descriptions, the one that is so vast that it becomes nearly definite, namely the one made with 'all' in English and <B>ra</B> in Loglan:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(5)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ra humni ga razdou [rahz-DOH-oo] </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">All humans reason (i.e., give reasons).</TD></TR>

<!-- .H4.25 NUMERICAL PREDICATES WITH -RA -RI -->
<P>We will see in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.28">Section 4.28</A> on the non-designating variables how there are other, logically more manipulable ways of saying (5). But for the moment let us simply note that the grammatical structure of (5) reflects by far the most common way of expressing universal claims in natural language. Indeed, what (5) claims is clear enough but rather reckless, namely that there isn't a human being anywhere who doesn't, in appropriate circumstances, give reasons.</P>
<P>More realistically we might claim</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(6)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Sa humni ga razdou </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Almost all humans reason.</TD></TR>

<H2><A NAME="sec4.25">4.25</A> Numerical Predicates with <B>-ra</B> and <B>-ri</B></H2>


<P>The three final uses of numbers in language are as predicates ('We were three'), as numerical descriptions ('She loved the number three'), and as names ('He came at three'.). We will deal with numerical predicates in this section, with numerical descriptions in the next, and with numerical names in the one after that. This will conclude our discussion of numbers...which cut a fairly wide swath through the language.
</P>
<P>If we say 'It was a football eleven', 'We made a foursome at golf', or 'Those are five-gallon cans', it is clear that we are using numbers, not to quantify arguments, but to predicate numerical properties of things. In English we use the same words to quantify arguments ('The five men came') as we use within descriptions ('Those are five-gallon cans') and this leads to a widespread class of ambiguities, e.g., 'Bring me those five gallon cans.' We must obviously design such ambiguities out of Loglan. Moreover, since numbers used as predicates <EM>are</EM> predicates, and therefore participate in the whole grammar of predicates, it is clear that we would introduce an unfortunate inconsistency into the morphology of the language if we decided to use the two-letter number words, which are among the shortest of the operators, as predicate words. For both these reasons, then, numerical predicates are formed in Loglan by adding suffixes to number words.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>The first series of numerical predicates are the <EM>cardinal predicates</EM>. These are formed by adding the suffix -<B>ra</B> to any number word. Thus 'onesome', 'twosome', 'threesome', and so on--or, alternatively, 'monad', 'dyad', 'triad', etc.--are simply <B>nera</B>, <B>tora</B>, <B>tera</B>, and so on, in Loglan.<SUP><A HREF="#note29">29</A></SUP> The Loglan words are used exactly like any other predicate words:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Mu tera </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">We are three (that is, a threesome).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/muTERa/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ta fera galno<SUP><A HREF="#note30">30</A></SUP> veslo</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">That's a five-gallon can (i.e., a fivesome gallon container).</TD></TR>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dapaFUTboneNERa/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Thus the cardinal predicates may be used alone, as in (1); they may modify other predicates, as in (2); and they may be modified by other predicates, as in (3). No particular difficulty attends the use of these words. They are obviously one-place predicates; they may be used in particular descriptions (<B>le fora</B> = 'the foursome'), or in mass descriptions (<B>lo tora</B> = 'pairs', that is, 'all the twosomes there are'); and they may even figure in abstract descriptions. For example, <B>lopu tera</B> means 'threeness', or the property that all threesomes share. Obviously, there is an infinite number of such abstract individuals. They may, in fact, be nothing more than the abstract creatures called numbers themselves.</P>
<P>Like all predicates, the numerical predicates are stressed penultimately. This means that their front-ends must be protected from accidentally absorbing whatever number words may precede them. How do we say 'Bring me those five five-gallon cans' in Loglan? And do so in such a way that our listeners will know that we don't want the fifty-five-gallon cans? The answer is simple. We pause in the first case, and scrupulously <EM>fail</EM> to pause in the second. (After all, <EM>fefera</EM> = 'fifty-five-some' is a single word; and we know that pausing inside a word can sometimes be misinforming.) These are the two utterances we seek:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Kambei mi leva fe, fera galno veslo </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Bring me those five five-gallon cans.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/KAMbeimilevafeFERaGALnoVESlo/</CENTER></P>

<!-- .H4.26 NUMERICAL DESCRIPTION WITH LIO -->
<P>Note that it is clarifying to stress the last syllable before the crucial pause in (4). The stress needn't be emphatic; but there should be at least a slight rise in the stress contour immediately before the pause. Whether one uses a comma (,) or not to mark these obligatory pause in text is optional.</P>
<P>The second class of numerical predicates are the <EM>ordinal predicates</EM> like 'first', 'second', 'third', and so on, in English. These are the predicates which describe the positions of things in ordered series. In Loglan they are formed with the suffix <B>-ri</B>: <B>neri</B>, <B>tori</B> and <B>teri</B>, and so on.<SUP><A HREF="#note31">31</A></SUP> Like the cardinals, the ordinal predicates are handled grammatically like all other predicates; and like them, too, they have initial stress. Unlike the cardinals, the ordinals are two-place forms:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(6)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">La Djan, pa neri </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">John was first.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/mipaneNIRileCLIna/</CENTER></P>

<P>For obviously, if one is to be tenth in something, there must be something to be tenth in. Perhaps not quite so obviously, that something must be a series long enough to have ten members. This consideration, incidentally, shows that there are not only an infinite number of ordinal predicates, but also an infinite number of <EM>converse</EM> ordinal predicates of the following form:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(9)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da nu neniri </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X is a series with ten or more members.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/danuTERilaDJAN/</CENTER>
</P>


<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Now there is no reason why we cannot also apply the suffixes -<B>ra</B> and -<B>ri</B> to the non-numerical quantifiers of the preceding section and produce even more of these predicates. Thus <B>Da rara</B> means that X is literally everything (that is, an "allsome"); <B>Da rora</B>, that it has many members (a "manysome"); <B>Da sunera</B><SUP><A HREF="#rnote8">R8</A></SUP>, that it has at least one member (a "somesome"); and so on. The non-numerical ordinals are even more interesting. For example, <B>Da rari</B> must mean that X is the last member in some series, for literally it is the "allth" member. We can also talk in Loglan of the "manyth" member (<B>Da rori</B>), and even of the "fewth" member (<B>Da riri</B>); for nothing prevents our extending the ordinal ideas of Loglan in this curious direction, too. Again, in the effort to accommodate the natural languages, we have overshot them. And if someone asks you (in Loglan) if your position in the movie queue is close enough to the box office to make success probable, you have the splendid opportunity to reply laconically:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(11)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Mi ruri </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">I am "enoughth".</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/miRURi/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Apart from these curiosities, there are a great many quite ordinary English expressions that can be translated into numerical predicates with great directness. A 'big group', for example, is simply a set with many members, that is, a 'manysome' or <B>rora</B>. A 'little group' is clearly one with few members, that is, a 'fewsome' or <B>rira</B>.</P>
<P>Note that ordinals, too, are penultimately stressed.</P>

<P>(There is more on identity sentences in Chapter 5.) Notice that the whole numerical description made with <B>lio</B> is penultimately stressed. Thus the phrase <B>lio to</B> is stressed as [lee-OH-toh] or, phonemically, /liOto/, while the longer phrase <B>lio sokuate</B> is stressed as /liosoKUAte/ with level stress on <B>lio</B>. It is as if the descriptor <B>lio</B> were a prefix that attached itself to the number word and the compound word so formed were <EM>then</EM> required to be penultimately stressed. This makes sense. Numerical descriptions may be indefinitely long. But they must not be allowed to absorb the quantifers that happen to follow them. Penultimate stress reckoned over the whole of such expressions allows their endings to be uniquely determined; and of course the <B>lio</B>-segment itself marks their beginnings.</P>
<P>The two descriptions equated in (3) designate the same individual, namely the number two. Which designation we choose to use in any given case will be governed by the same kinds of considerations--about what the listener may be expected to know, what will be useful to da, and so on--as governs our choice between <B>La Djan</B> and <B>La Djek</B>, or between <B>Leva mrenu</B> and <B>Leva fumna</B> in the sentence <B>Leva fumna pa mrenu</B>. In short, that there are many names for the same number should give us no pause.</P>
<P>In English translation, the word <B>lio</B> has roughly the sense of the phrase 'the number' in such sentences as 'The number one trillion is hard to think about.' But notice that the phrase 'The number...' is not obligatory in such sentences in English. One may also say 'One trillion is hard to think about' with approximately the same effect...although perhaps in the latter case one is tempted to ask 'One trillion what?'. It is not at all clear that it is the <EM>number</EM> one trillion that is designated in the second sentence.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>In any case, <B>lio</B> is obligatory in similar sentences in Loglan. Saying <B>Fo kurnuu</B> /fokurNUu/ without it--<B>kurnuu</B> means 'is a square number'--will not convey what you intended if what you intended to say is that the number four is a square. What you have actually said is a designation, an argument without a predicate such as might be the answer to a question. <B>Fo kurnuu</B> could be translated correctly, if laboriously, into 'some four instances of the set of square numbers', or more neatly 'four squares'. So it is important to say <B>lio</B> in Loglan when you mean it.</P>
<P>Another kind of ambiguity that is resolved by <B>lio</B> is illustrated by the following pair of sentences:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da cmalo </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X is small.</TD></TR>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(5)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Lio da cmalo </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">The number X is small.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/liOdaCMAlo/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>In (5) the variable <B>da</B> is used mathematically; that is, <B>Lio da</B> is the designation of a number whose identity is (usually) unknown. Perhaps all we know about it is that it is small. But in (4) the argument <B>da</B> may designate anything the speaker wishes to designate...including a number. One may also use letter variables as the operands of <B>lio</B>-descriptions. For example, <B>lio b</B>-- pronounced [lee-OH-bay]--means 'the number b'.</P>
<P>Another important use of <B>lio</B> is in connection with the <EM>scalar predicates</EM>. These are the words in every modern language that name the units of our numerous measurement scales. Some examples are <B>dalra</B> ('is a dollar/be worth...dollar(s)'), <B>metro</B> ('is a meter/be... meter(s) long'), <B>gramo</B> ('is a gram/weigh...gram(s)'), and we have already encountered <B>galno</B> ('is a gallon/be...gallon(s) in volume'). The "default" value of the argument in the second place of all scalar predicates is <B>lio ne</B> /liOne/, that is, 'the number one'. Thus <B>Ti dalra</B> is short for <B>Ti dalra lio ne</B> /tiDALraliOne/ and means 'That's a dollar' or 'That's worth a dollar', or in literal translation--which is always worth trying to figure out for each new usage you encounter--<B>Ti dalra</B> means 'This is worth in dollars exactly one'...a dollar-bill, perhaps. Similarly, <B>Ta gramo</B> means 'That's a gram' or, literally, 'This weighs in grams exactly one'...a one-gram weight, almost certainly. (Hardly anything else comes out that neatly!!)</P>
<P>But if, now, we wish to say that something that we have weighed with some care weighs 33.1 milligrams, say, description with <B>lio</B> is available to help us do it: <B>Ti milgramo lio tetepine</B> /timilGRAmo.liotetePINe/, or, in the abbreviated textual style we prefer for numerical expressions in both English and Loglan, <B>Ti milgramo lio 33.1</B>. The second expression is, of course, read aloud in exactly the same way as the first. And remember that stress remains determinedly penultimate in <B>lio</B>-descriptions whether it falls on a decimal point or not.</P>
<!-- .H4.26 NUMERICAL DESCRIPTION WITH LIO -->
<P>The affix <B>mil-</B> in the scalar predicate <B>milgramo</B> comes from <B>milti</B> 'is a thousandth part of...'. <B>Milti</B> is one of a series of <EM>multiplier predicates</EM>, which includes <B>pikti, nanti, mikti centi,</B> and <B>decti</B> on the small side, and <B>dekto, hekto, kilto, mirdo, megdo</B> and <B>gigdo</B> on the large side. These provide Loglan renderings of the familiar scientific measurement affixes: <B>pik-</B> ('pico-'), <B>nan-</B> ('nano-'), <B>mik-</B> ('micro-'), <B>mil-</B> ('milli-'), <B>cen-</B> [shen-] ('centi-'), <B>dec-</B> [desh-] ('deci-') as well as the ascending series <B>dek-</B> ('deka-' or 'deca'), <B>hek-</B> ('hekt(o)-'or 'hect(o)-'), <B>kil-</B> ('kilo-'), <B>mir-</B> ('myri(a)-'), <B>meg-</B> ('mega-') and <B>gig-</B> ('giga-'). So Loglandia, too, can eventually learn to spend its <EM>gigdalra</EM>. The multiplier predicates themselves predicate metrical properties of individuals or sets. Thus, if I say <B>Da gigdo de di</B>, I am saying that X is a billion times bigger than, or more than, Y on dimension Z. If Z is not mentioned, it is usually assumed that the dimension is numerical; that is, that set X has a billion times more members than set Y. Similarly, <B>Da nanti de di</B> says that X is a billionth part of Y on dimension Z...whence <B>De gigdo da di</B>. In short, <B>nanti</B> = <B>nu gigdo</B>; <B>decti</B> = <B>nu dekto</B>; and so on.</P>
<P>There is another, sometimes more convenient, way of talking about numerical facts than using either scalar or multiplier predicates; and this requires another kind of predicate, the <EM>dimension predicate</EM>. Fewer than the scalar predicates but more commonly used, they are the words for the various dimensions humans have so far succeeded in measuring. Examples are <B>langa</B> [LANG-gah] ('is longer than...by amount...'), <B>laldo</B> [LAHL-doh] ('is older than...by amount...'), <B>tidjo</B> ('is heavier than...by amount...'), <B>nerji</B> [NEHR-zhee] ('has more energy than...by amount...'), and so on. Notice that, when specified, the third arguments of all these dimension predicates will be designations of amounts. To be meaningful, these amounts must, of course, be expressed in units appropriate to that particular dimension, that is, they must be <EM>dimensioned numbers</EM>. For example, 'three inches' is a dimensioned number in English, which, when properly expressed in Loglan, might be used with the predicate <B>langa</B>. In another example, '33.0 cg', which we would read aloud in English as 'thirty-three-point-zero centigrams', might be suitable for use with <B>tidjo</B>; and '700 MYA' which, if we know what the English letters stand for, we would read aloud as 'seven-hundred-million years ago', might be appropriate to one of the many scales on which <B>lopu laldo</B> is measured. Loglan, too, has a full array of dimensioned numbers. The ingredients from which they are made will be found in Appendices A, B and D.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>With both dimension predicates and dimensioned numbers we can now make quantitative comparisons. Suppose that brass object over there is a standard 5-kilogram weight. Suppose this sack of flour weighs 8.1kg. Then we can say </P>

</P>

Notice the <B>mue</B> label on the dimension kg in the quantity.  I would prefer to write <B>tepinemuekeigei</B> here.  An acronym appearing as a dimension must start with <B>mue</B> (which may suggest "measures") due to phonetic difficulties with acronyms.<SUP><A HREF="rnote9">R9</A></SUP><p>

<P><B>Lio 3.1kg</B> is, of course, the Loglan designation of the international dimensioned number 3.1 kg, a designation which could be translated literally as 'the number 3.1 kg'. We might think that the numerical part of the Loglan expression was just another instance of the familiar Loglan quantifier, but in fact the expressions <B>3.1kg</B> and <B>3</B> have exactly the same grammatical privileges in Loglan. Both may be preceded by <B>lio</B>. Both may function as quantifiers. Thus we may speak of <B>3.1kg sulfo</B> ('3.1 kg of sulfur') as readily as we may speak of <B>3 sulfo</B> ('3 sulfurs', three lumps of sulfur, perhaps?), and of course a good deal more precisely.

<P>With the dimensioned numbers we reach the level of precision required by science. Yet no grammatical novelties are afoot here. Sentences (6) through (9) have exactly the same grammatical structure. Evidently a Loglan quantifier may be any mathematical expression whatsoever.</P>
<!-- .H4.26 NUMERICAL DESCRIPTION WITH LIO -->
<P>Let's now look at the dimension part of dimensioned numbers. The <B>kg</B> part of the expression <B>3.1kg</B> stands for the pair of letter-words <B>keigei</B> [kay-gay], prefixed with the required <B>mue</B>. These are the words for the lower-case Latin letterals that constitute the Loglan, as well as the international, symbol for this unit of measurement, the kilogram. The Loglan scalar predicate for this unit is <B>kilgramo</B> as it might be used in <B>Ti kilgramo</B>, 'This weighs a kilogram.' The word is derived from <B>kilto gramo</B> = 'thousandfold-gram', with obvious affinities with English and French 'kilogram(me)', Spanish 'kilogramo', Italian 'chilogramma', and so on. But when loglanists read the written expression <B>3.1kg</B> aloud, they will read it, not as <B>tepine kilgramo</B> on a misleading analogy with the English 'three-point-one kilograms', but as the compound little word <B>tepinemuekeigei</B> /tepinemueKEIgei/; and this spoken word may always be generated simply by reading the individual numerals and letterals in the textual expression aloud. It is just as if we read '3.1kg' aloud as 'three-point-one-kay-gee' in English. We don't but could, and in Loglan we do.</P>
<P><B>Tepine kilgramo</B> does mean something, of course, but not 'three-point-one kilograms'. It means '(any) three-point-one things that weigh one kilogram each'. There are contexts in which this curious designation might be useful. In any European supermarket, for example, there are many things that weigh (approximately) 1 kilogram. Any 3.1 of them would satisfy this designation.</P>
<P>The utility of comparative measurements like (6) is fairly limited, however. More frequently we wish to say that this single object in our hand, for example, weighs 30 grams, or is 5 inches long, or is probably 37,000 +/- 500 years old, without comparing it to anything else. In short, we wish to report our measurement of it directly. There is a third group of predicates that enable us to do that, namely the <EM>measurement predicates</EM>. These are all complex predicates made by attaching <B>mel-</B> or <B>mely-</B>, a prefix derived from <B>merli</B> = '(to) measure...to be...on scale...', to some dimension predicate like <B>tidjo</B>, <B>langa</B> or <B>laldo</B>. For example, <B>melylanga</B> [mel-uh-LAHNG-gah] means '...is measured-in-length to be...'.</P>

<P>The expression <B>piuceniu</B> [pyoo-sheh-nyooo] means 'plus-<EM>and</EM>-minus' and translates English 'plus-or-minus'; the Loglan connective is the correct one because it defines a range.</P>
<P>The Loglan scalar predicate for 'year', or rather for 'lasted... years', is <B>nirne</B>. So the international unit for years is represented in Loglan by the symbol <B>n</B> (read [nay]). Note from the pronunciation of (12) that pauses may be optionally introduced into a numerical description. They may occur at any point between its head-mark /lio/ and its stressed penult, in this case /MA/. This is because the appearance of the head-mark ultimately followed by a stressed vowel is sufficient to resolve such strings uniquely no matter how many pauses occur between them. (In 2013, I am leaving this paragraph alone, but our arrangements are not exactly the same.  Pauses are allowed in NI words, for different reasons.  I did not implement a stress requirement in LIO phrases and do not require this for them to terminate.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="sec4.27">4.27</A> Numerical Names</H2>


<P>The last class of number words need not detain us long. These are the names of the objects we sometimes wish to hail by their numerical properties. Years are such objects; times of day; musical compositions ('The Beethoven Quartet') and groups ('The Dreadful Dozen'); and last but certainly not least, those abstract creatures called numbers themselves.</P>
<P>All such objects are very simply named in Loglan. As suggested in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.19">Section 4.19</A>, we may always make a name from a little word or little-word compound by adding the suffix -<B>n</B>. Thus <B>Nen</B>, <B>Ton</B>, <B>Fon</B>, etc., form an infinite class of names which may then be used exactly as the name-words <B>Djan</B>, <B>Pit</B>, <B>Bab</B> and <B>Kat</B>, <B>Kan</B>, <B>Rat</B> and <B>Far</B> are used. If you want to talk <EM>to</EM> something with a numerical name, you may address it by using that name vocatively ('Oh 1988, how cruel you have been!'). But more frequently, you will want to talk <EM>about</EM> these things, and this requires the use of the name operator <B>la</B>. Thus <B>la Ten</B> may be used to designate the number three, the local musical trio, three in the afternoon, or anything else that has three parts or members. For it may serve, of course--just as 'John' does--as the name of many things. Thus <B>la Ten</B> is often used in Loglan as the translation of 'three o'clock', and <B>la Nevevoven</B> /laneveVOven/ is one of the expressions you may use if you wanted to talk about, and not to, the year 1989. Normally, of course, polysyllabic names are penultimately stressed.</P>
<P>The loglanist should remember, however, that anything that may be given a numerical name (<B>la Nevevoven</B>) may also be given a predicate name of roughly the same import by using one of the numerical predicates. Thus <B>la Nevevoveri</B> /laNEvevoVERi/ would mean '(the) Nineteen-Eighty-Ninth (Year)', and the Dreadful Dozen might be more mellifluously named <B>la Nu Firpa Netora</B> /lanuFIRpaneTORa/, using the techniques of <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.18">Section 4.18</A>, than <B>la Nufirp Neton</B> /laNUfirp.NEton/, using those of 4.19 and this section. Mellifluousness may not be what is wanted here, however.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>But whatever is wanted, the Loglan name-coiner has many colors on da's pallette.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.28">4.28</A> Indirect Designation with <B>lae</B> and <B>lue</B></H2>


<P>Occasionally we designate something by pointing to a sign or address of that thing. We say 'Bring me 129' when what we really want is something with that number pasted on it or written next to its name on a list. This is indirect designation. We first designate something that can serve as a sign of something else--a label or a title or an address, or a bit of smoke in the room--and then indicate that it is the thing behind that label or title or bit of smoke that we really want to talk about. In English we can do this quite openly by saying 'Bring me the car with the number 129 pasted on the windshield'; but we seldom bother. We content ourselves--as we often do in natural language--with saying something that we don't really mean, confident that the listener will understand that we mean something else.</P>
<P>In Loglan we would like to do better than that...especially as we will sometimes be talking to computers. So we have an indirect designator <B>lae</B> [lah-eh], and we use the argument-form <B>lae X</B> to designate anything of which X may be taken as a sign. <B>X</B> might be a designation of a street address, for example. In that case, <B>lae X</B> could be used as a designation of the "occupants". <B>X</B> may be of any grammatical type whatever: a description, a quotation, a name, number, or even a variable. But whatever <B>X</B> points to directly must be something that can <EM>then</EM> be taken as a sign of what the speaker really means to designate.</P>
<P>Here are some examples:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Kambei mi laelie, War y and y Peace.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Bring me 'War and Peace'.</TD></TR>

<P>The English speaker isn't <EM>really</EM> saying what da means, of course, and would be disconcerted--perhaps even vastly annoyed--if handed a slip of paper on which the words 'war and peace' had been quickly scribbled. The Loglan speaker <EM>is</EM> saying what de means, however, for de has, in effect, asked de's listener to look for something to which, or on which, the words 'War and Peace' will serve as some kind of sign--they will be printed in gold letters on its cover, perhaps--and to bring de <EM>that</EM> thing, please.</P>
<!-- .H4.28 INDIRECT DESIGNATION WITH LAE SAE -->
<P>In the next few sentences we're going to need the predicate for 'tell' or 'inform', which is "knowledge-give" in Loglan, or <B>djadou</B> [jah-DOH-oo] from <B>djano donsu</B>.</P>

<P>What the English speaker has said <EM>outside</EM> the parentheses is 'Tell me about your smile.'...which is pretty vague. In Loglan this vague enquiry would be conveyed by speaking (2) without <B>lae</B>, or <B>Djadou mi lepo tu crano</B> = 'Inform me (give me knowledge) about your smile.' What the English parenthetic clause and the Loglan <B>lae</B> operator both convey, however, is that the speaker wants to know what the listener's smile is a sign of. In short, what invisible thing is going on inside the listener of which di's smile is possibly the only outward sign.</P>

More explicitly we might say to such a person 'What does your presence mean?'. We don't know how to ask questions yet in Loglan. (Questions and similar matters will be dealt with in Chapter 5.) But we do know how to say with <B>djadou</B> and <B>lae</B> 'Tell me of what you are a sign.'</P>
<P>The operator <B>lue</B> works in the opposite direction from <B>lae</B>. It produces a designation of a <EM>sign</EM> of a thing from a designation of that thing. Thus if some Loglan expression <B>X</B> is a designation of something X, then <B>lue X</B> is a designation of some sign of X...X's name, for example, or a label, or the smoke trailing behind X as X passes. Thus</P>

<!-- .H4.29 PREDIFICATION WITH ME -->
<P>Just as <B>le</B> and <B>la</B> turn predicates into arguments, so the little word <B>me</B> [meh] turns arguments into predicates. It "predifies" them. Like <B>lae</B> and <B>lue</B>, <B>me</B> accepts any sort of argument as its operand. This includes names, descriptions, quotations, numbers...even variables. Usually, <B>me-</B> is prefixed to the arguments it predifies. Thus the cryptic 'That's me' as said by a speaker trying on a costume--in the sense of suiting da or expressing da--has an almost literal translation into Loglan:</P>

<P>Sometimes <B>me</B>-predicates are used to express such fleeting notions that there would be no point in ever building literal predicates for them. Predified quotations are often instances of such ephemeral predications:</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/laKAN.pameLI.miDANzalepoHASfaGODzi.luBLEkami/</CENTER>
</P>


<P>In this last sentence, the whole phrase <B>meli, Mi danza lepo hasfa godzi, lu</B> has been predified by its leading <B>me</B>, and the predicate it precedes and therefore modifies is the main predicate of the sentence <B>bleka</B> = 'looks at'.</P>
<P>In English, we don't quite know what to make of such constructions...especially when we try to use them in text. Sometimes we hyphenate them ('He gave me that I-want-to-leave look'); sometimes we put them in a different style of quotation marks from the ones we use for ordinary speech ('She shot back a "Don't be silly!" frown'); and sometimes (in despair) we capitalize the initial letters of the principal words in the predified phrase to indicate that something special is afoot here but we don't quite know what: 'It was God Save the King week when we arrived in London.'</P>
<P>In Loglan, the predifier <B>me</B> always makes it clear what we are doing. We are turning these bits of copied or invented speech into predicates, and we are then free to use them in any way that other predicates might be used to get the job done. Often the semantic effect is pleasantly vague. But as mentioned above, we often make do with predified arguments because we don't know of any proper predicates with which to say what needs to be said.</P>
<P>In sentence (8) a speaker might feel that the long predified term might be more conveniently spoken last. To put it last, da may invert the predicate string with <B>go</B> just as if the <B>me</B>-ed expression were a single predicate word:</P>

<!-- .H4.30 THE NON-DESIGNATING VARIABLES -->
<P>But to do this, notice that we must first link <B>mi</B> to <B>bleka</B> with <B>je</B>. This is because when a deferred modifier is to be linked to its modificand with <B>go</B>, the modificand must first be linked to all its (soon to become internal) arguments with <B>je</B>...<B>jue</B>...(See <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.12">Section 4.12</A>). Notice how linking with <EM>je</EM> advises the ear that an adverbial <B>go</B>-phrase is probably coming up. There is no other reason to link arguments to the main predicate of a sentence than that they are about to become internal.</P>
<P>Finally, here's a <B>me</B>-expression that is applied to <B>me</B> itself:</P>

<H2><A NAME="sec4.30">4.30</A> The Non-Designating Variables <B>ba be bo bu</B></H2>


<P>When a speaker of English wants to talk about something or someone da cannot properly designate, da frequently uses the words 'something' or 'someone'. In Loglan the four variables <B>ba be bo bu</B> are used for this same purpose. (Note that <B>bi</B> is missing from this series; <B>bi</B> is the identity operator and will be discussed in the next chapter.)</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/bapaCRIna/</CENTER></P>

<P>All these sentences express in both languages the speaker's inability to locate the thing or things the sentence is about. Or, as we might say from sentence (1), da doesn't know what bit him. All da knows is that da was bitten. And da infers from this that there exists something x that did the biting.<SUP><A HREF="#note36">36</A></SUP> Similarly, who is prepared to designate the cloud from which rain falls? We will use the lower-case letters x, y and z in English text to represent these non-designating variables.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Logicians call sentences which make claims of this kind <EM>existential propositions</EM>. Their claims are minimal. For all that is necessary to establish the truth of (1), for example, is to find that there exists something somewhere that bit the speaker.<SUP><A HREF="#note37">37</A></SUP> How different this is from the same sentence with a definite designation:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%"><EM>Da</EM> pa ditka mi</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X bit me.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/<EM>DA</EM>paDITkami/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>For sentence (4) accuses a definite culprit, X, where (1) only vaguely proposes that the crime occurred. As a consequence, (4) is easy to refute, for the accused--whom we can presumably locate--is either guilty or da is not. In contrast, (1) is almost impossible to refute. For how many "somethings" do we have to examine before our failure to find one that satisfies some given predicate may be taken as conclusive? The answer is, all of them. And that is everything there is. It is in this sense that existential propositions make minimal claims about the world.</P>
<P>Logically, the non-designating variables are very important. For example, they permit the clear expression of just these minimal claims that are often disguised with the indefinite article in the Indo-European languages. Thus the mystery of English 'a' and 'an' is resolved at once with this device. For consider what it means to say:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) A man came.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Is it not equivalent to saying?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(6) Something was a man and came.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>And this in turn finds its very clear expression in Loglan:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(7)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ba mrenu, e pa kamla</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Some x is a man and came.<SUP><A HREF="#note38">38</A></SUP></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/baMREnu.epaKAMla/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>As we saw in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.24">Section 4.24</A> on the art of indefinite description, we may also translate (5) into Loglan with what amounts to Loglan's indefinite article, the quantifier <B>su</B> ('at least one'):</P>
<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(8)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Su mrenu pa kamla</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">At least one man came.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/suMREnupaKAMla/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Logically (7) and (8) make identical claims, and the Loglan speaker is free to use whichever form da pleases. (8) is a little more economical than (7) in that the implied connective <B>e</B> and its associated pause do not have to be spoken in the <B>Su preda</B>-form. On the other hand, the <B>Ba preda e</B>-form is logically more explicit, and loglanists will often prefer to use it for that reason.</P>
<!-- .H4.30 THE NON-DESIGNATING VARIABLES -->
<P>In choosing between forms like (7) and (8), one must also be wary of the temptation to follow one's English habits, some of which, I am sorry to say, are almost certain to be bad. For example, the English translation I have given for (8) ('At least one man came') is often an incorrectly abbreviated form of quite a different English claim:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(9)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">At least one of the men (I have in mind) came. </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Su le mrenu pa kamla</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/suleMREnupaKAMla/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Many English speakers regularly use the English of (8) when they mean the English--and therefore the Loglan--of (9). If you have such speech-habits in English, it would be wise to use the more explicit existential form of (7) when making claims of this kind in Loglan.</P>
<P>The difference between the claims of (8) and (9) is not trivial. Its importance may be sensed if we remember that (8) is actually an abbreviation of</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(10)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Su le ra mrenu pa kamla </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">At least one of the set of all men came.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/suleraMREnupaKAMla/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>And when we also consider that the sets involved in sentences like (9) hardly ever have more than ten or a hundred members, the large logical difference between the two kinds of claim becomes apparent. Sentences like (10) claim the existence of an unknown and unlocatable man that came, hardly more. Sentences like (9) identify the man that came as a member of a locatable set. That is a long way toward having his address.</P>
<P>In short, it is alright to use <B>Su preda</B> when one really does mean to make the minimal existential claim of (7) and (10), but at no other times. The logically safest bet--in any language--is to speak existentially (i.e., with 'something's and 'someone's or <B>ba</B>'s and <B>be</B>'s) when one's claim is existential. So in a logical language, the <B>Ba preda e</B>-form of (7) may come to be preferred over the simpler indefinite description of (8).</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>There is another reason why the longer <B>Ba preda e</B>-form may be favored by loglanists who are attracted by the idea of "talking symbolic logic". The original English sentence (5) seems to involve only one predicate idea, namely that something came. But as (6) and (7) suggest, <EM>two</EM> claims are actually afoot here, namely that something came <EM>and</EM> was a man. How obscure the English form with the indefinite descriptor 'a' really is! For on the misleading parallel with a very similar sentence containing the definite article,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(11) <EM>The</EM> man came.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>we are tempted to think in English that sentence (5) uses the predicate word 'man' in a designation, and hence that it is not part of the speaker's claim at all.<SUP><A HREF="#note39">39</A></SUP> This is the first error. The second is that we are tempted to think that the phrases 'a man' and <B>su mrenu</B> are designations, but "indefinite" ones, as an English-speaking grammarian might call them. They are indefinite <EM>quantifications</EM>, as we have already seen. But the set over which the quantifiers <B>su</B> and 'at least one' operate is the set of <EM>all</EM> men; and so to qualify as <EM>some</EM> man, one must be something x which really <EM>is</EM> a man; and this is not designation but predication.<SUP><A HREF="#note40">40</A></SUP> We are claiming that this indefinite something x, whoever and wherever it may be, actually is a man.</P>
<P>This is an important and subtle difference. The thing I mean when I say 'The man came' needn't be a man for my sentence to be true. That man may be a woman. But the thing I mean--but do not know the location or identity of, and therefore cannot designate--when I say 'A man came' <EM>must</EM> be a man for my sentence to be true. Thus two predications are afoot in the sentences with indefinite descriptions as we originally surmised. And unlike all other variables, the non-designating variables <B>ba be bo</B>, with which we make such claims, do not designate anything at all. Hence their name. Their use reveals, in fact, the speaker's intention <EM>not</EM> to designate--not to give the perpetrator's location away ('Someone broke it')--even when da can.<SUP><A HREF="#note41">41</A></SUP></P>
<P>Another use of the non-designating variables is in "universals." These are the general claims about the world that people make when they are feeling incautious ('All crows are black') or didactic ('All whales are mammals'). Here is an instance of the incautious variety, first in rather literary English:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(12) All who love the Sun, love Spain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Then in a style of English that is logically more sophisticated:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(13) If anyone loves the Sun, then he loves Spain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Then in Loglan:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(14)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Raba cluva la Sol, noa la Espanias </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Each something x loves the Sun only if (it loves) Spain.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/rabaCLUvalaSOL.noala.esPANias/</CENTER>
</P>

<!-- .H4.30 THE NON-DESIGNATING VARIABLES -->
<P>(The pause before /esPANias/ is the one required everywhere in Loglan before vowel-initial words, and is usually very short: a glottal stop.)</P>
<P>Now we may observe two things about this Loglan sentence. First, by quantifying the non-designating variable <B>ba</B> with the "all"-operator <B>ra</B>, we are suddenly talking about everything there is. For every something x is indeed everything, for each something x can be anything at all. This apparently reckless move is called "universal quantification",<SUP><A HREF="#note42">42</A></SUP> and we will deal with it more fully in Chapter 5 (specifically, <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.17">Section 5.17</A>). But for the moment we need only remark that it allows us to convert the weak existential claim of</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/baCLUvalaSOL.noala.esPANias/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>into a conjunction of an infinite number of such claims about all the somethings that there are. It is in this sense that <B>Ra ba</B> means that for every something x, some specified thing about each x is true.</P>
<P>Second, note that each time we apply (14) to a new something it says only that <EM>if</EM> that particular something is a lover of the Sun, <EM>then</EM> it is (also) a lover of Spain. But this implication will almost always be trivially true. For the vast majority of somethings--including your pencil, the Moon, and the electron hovering at the tip of your nose--do <EM>not</EM> love the Sun; and this makes it true of them that if they love the Sun (as they don't) they also love Spain (but don't have to). It is the genius of modern logic to have discovered that an infinite number of trivialities, plus a few non-trivialities--and these concern in this case those relatively few somethings that love the Sun--adds up to something that is not trivial, namely a generalization. In this case, what is non-trivial is the generalization we can now make about Sun-lovers without designating them--or even pretending that we can--namely, that whoever and wherever they are, they all love Spain.</P>
<P>Logicians call such sentences <EM>universal propositions</EM>; and though they are built, as you see, on the same non-designating variables as the existential sentences are, they claim much more.</P>
<P>Here are some further examples of universals built with <B>Raba</B> and <B>noa</B>:<SUP><A HREF="#note43">43</A></SUP></P>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>The grammar of these Loglan remarks is plain. Each involves a connected predicate formed with the implicative connective <B>noa</B>; and each involves a non-designating variable of the <B>ba</B>-series which is quantified with the universal quantifier <B>ra</B>. Other argument terms may be involved, and these may either be designations, like <B>la Sol</B> in (14), or other non-designating variables, like <B>be</B> in (17). But the essential requirements of a universal claim in Loglan are that it contain, first, at least one universally-quantified non-designating variable, and second, a connection made with <B>noa</B>. As we have already suggested with sentence (14), and as we will see in detail in the next section, this essential connection may involve one of the arguments instead of the predicate of the sentence.</P>
<P>But how elegant the natural languages are! 'Lions eat meat' is surely a most satisfying abbreviation of the complex notion shown explicitly in <B>Raba simba noa mitro titci</B>. But also how obscure! For 'Lions live in Kenya' (<EM>some</EM> lions do, but some do not) and 'Lions are found all over Africa' (lionkind is so distributed, but no individual lion or set of lions is) are English sentences which use the same grammatical form to make entirely different claims. In Loglan we have sacrificed this elegance to penetrate this obscurity; and the result is sometimes clumsier but always clear. Besides, we can imitate the Indo-European languages fairly closely when we want to, and we will often want to when translating from these natural tongues. Thus</P>

<P>But Loglan has an even more telling advantage over English in the matter of universals. For observe that nearly every grammatical form of the English noun can be used to make a universal claim. Thus, not only the plural noun without an article, as in 'Lions eat meat', but also the plural noun with an article can be used to make the same claim:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(21) The lions eat meat (as opposed to the zebras, say).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>But we also say,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(22) The lion eats meat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>and mean exactly the same thing, though grammatically this is now the singular noun with the definite article. And even the singular noun without an article is occasionally used to make a universal claim:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(23) Man eats meat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This last sentence definitely suggests the sense of the mass description in Loglan. Even so, it may be argued that in some contexts sentence (23) might be used to make a universal claim about individual men. But curiously enough even the singular noun with an <EM>indefinite</EM> article sometimes expresses a universal claim. For</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(24) A man eats meat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>in the same sense that 'A man fights back' ('if he is a man', we are tempted to add) also makes this universal claim. In fact there is only one form of the English noun construction that, so far as I know, is never used to make a universal claim; and that is what is called the "indefinite plural" form in 'Some men eat meat.' Thus five out of the six ways in which nouns are used in English are occasionally employed to make universal claims.</P>
<P>But the riotous way in which the speaker of English uses noun constructions to make universal statements suggests that something has gone wrong. It suggests that the frequency of use of universals has increased markedly since the grammatical bones of the language were laid down, and that the grammar of the language has not kept up with these new needs. At least <EM>something</EM> in the English mind seems to resist the explicitly provided universal form 'All men eat meat' in favor of the wildly-varied but abbreviated noun forms we have just surveyed. Perhaps the transformational clumsiness of the "all"-form compared to the elegant transformability of the more precise conditional, as in 'If something is a man then it eats meat', has already been felt by users of English. The suggestion of a suppressed conditional in the form 'A man eats meat (if he is a man)' seems to forecast even further development along this line.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>However this may be in English, or may become in the English usage of the future, the preferred form of the universal claim in Loglan compositions--as distinct from translations into Loglan from the natural languages where more imitative styles may be preferred--is the conditionally expressed claim with the universal quantifier:</P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/rabaMREnu.noaMIOtci/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>For this is the form that is most readily transformed into other forms. Many variations on this theme are possible as we shall see. But all of them involve the non-designating variables and a connection made with <B>noa</B>, or some other connection equally capable of expressing the conditional idea.<SUP><A HREF="#note45">45</A></SUP></P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.31">4.31</A> Optional Case Tags</H2>


<P>The prepositions that sometimes precede the arguments of Loglan predicates are called <EM>case tags</EM>. They "tag" selected arguments for their role in the sentence, especially when those arguments are out of their standard order. The standard order of the arguments of a Loglan predicate is, of course, the order in which they are spoken when that predicate is unconverted and its arguments are untagged. This is the "dictionary order" in which you have been shown the places of at least some of the predicates we have used. It is also the order in which you will find the places of predicates shown in Appendices B-F.</P>
<!-- .H4.31 OPTIONAL CASE TAGS -->
<P>Here is a sentence in which a tagged argument is not in standard order:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da pa donsu, beu [beigh-oo] de di </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X gave object Y (to) Z.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dapaDONsu.beudeDI/ </CENTER>
</P>

<P>The standard order of the arguments of <B>donsu</B> is donor-recipient-gift. This is the same as the unmarked order in English: 'X gives Z Y.'<SUP><A HREF="#note46">46</A></SUP> But by tagging <B>de</B> with the case tag <B>beu</B>, which we have translated 'object', we make it clear that Y is the gift. So we are free to put the new designation of the recipient, which is <B>beu de</B>, in an unusual position, namely in second position instead of third, which is the usual order of the designation of a gift in both Loglan and English.</P>
<P>Once the gift is tagged, we may also tag the recipient:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Da pa donsu, beu de, dio [dyoh] di </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">X gave object Y to recipient Z. </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/dapaDONsu.beuDE.dioDI/ </CENTER>
</P>

<P>This move would seem unnecessary to a loglanist unless da suspected da's listener de might profit from this "extra" information...as de would do if de were a learner, say. For the benefit of that learner, da might even tag the giver place and speak all the arguments in their standard order:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(3)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Kao [kough] da pa donsu, beu de, dio di </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Actor X gave object Y to recipient Z.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/kaodapaDONsu.beuDE.dioDI/ </CENTER>
</P>

<P>Although rare in English, this move gives the learner a maximum amount of information about the place-structure of the predicate de is learning. A similar move might be made by an instructor attempting to teach the idioms of English to foreigners.</P>
<P>Let's look at a more usual English sentence involving the same predicate notion:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) John gave his sister the puppy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>All the arguments in (4) are untagged. While the character of their designata allows us to guess who is giver, what is gift, and who is recipient, in the end it is the order of the unmarked arguments that determines their role in the sentence. To see this, let us exchange the second and third arguments of sentence (4) while leaving them unmarked:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) John gave the puppy his sister.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The claim is still clear enough. It's an absurd one now, or at best a sentimental one expressed metaphorically. But clearly with (5) the speaker is making a sharply different claim from that of (4). What emerges from exercises of this kind is that it is the <EM>position</EM> of an unmarked English argument that determines its role in the sentence.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>Now let us see the effect of tagging. If we tag 'his sister' in (4) with the preposition 'to', we may successfully speak its claim in two quite different orders:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(6) John gave the puppy to his sister.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(7) To his sister, John gave the puppy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We might even try the unusual move of putting the tagged argument before the verb:</P>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(8) John to his sister gave the puppy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That would also be understood in English. Tagged arguments are evidently quite mobile...in both languages.</P>
<P>We might try to explain the mobility produced by tagging in the following way. English prepositions like 'to' are evidently signs of particular English "cases", where by <EM>case</EM> we mean a category of sentential roles: for example, the roles played by subjects, objects, indirect objects, and so on, in sentences. 'To' is often a sign of the "dative" case in English; and that is the case to which all sorts of indirect objects--which include designations of destinations, beneficiaries and other recipients--are always assigned. English has several such cases, but only its pronouns are ever inflected for them. For example, 'he/him/his' and 'I/me/my' are the "nominative", "accusative" and "genitive" cases, respectively, of two English pronouns. But unlike the nouns of Latin and Greek, English nouns are never inflected for case. So if we want to mark English nouns and noun phrases for case--that is, for their role in the sentence--we must tag them with prepositions. (Notice that these are called "prepositions" because in English they are positioned <EM>before</EM> the objects they tag.) Once tagged, English nouns and noun phrases may be moved around at will without losing their case-identities.</P>
<!-- .H4.31 OPTIONAL CASE TAGS -->
<P>This is just what we do in Loglan. Loglan, of course, is a completely uninflected language. Moreover, it has no nouns, just predicates which may be used as arguments. But, like English, Loglan does have a set of optional prepositions with which speakers may tag the cases of their arguments when they want to move them around.</P>
<P>Unlike the English tagging system, the Loglan case tag system is formally complete. That is to say, it will assign a case, and hence a tag, to <EM>any</EM> place of <EM>any</EM> predicate. This is more than can be said for English, for example, some of whose noun cases, e.g., those of the subjects and direct objects we have already mentioned, are almost always unmarked. Loglan has eleven cases, and each is uniquely represented by a preposition that is used for nothing else; see the list at the end of this section. Among them, all the roles ever played by arguments in Loglan sentences are exhaustively provided for.</P>
<P>On the other hand, case-marking is never required in Loglan as it often is in English. Indeed, there are some English cases that are never untagged. In contrast, the Loglan case system is optional in the strong sense that the entire system may be dispensed with if a speaker or writer wishes to. A milder way of saying this is that the arguments of <EM>every</EM> Loglan predicate have an unmarked form. Indeed, the order of arguments in that unmarked form is their dictionary order, the order in which you will find them whenever that predicate is being defined. In contrast, relatively few <EM>complete</EM> English predicates even have an unmarked form. The verb '(to) give' happens to be one that has; but most do not. Try saying that Jack is the father of Sally through mother Jane without using prepositions. There is no unmarked English sentence that conveys this meaning. But in Loglan, as we know, this and every other multi-place claim may be made without using a single preposition: <B>La Djek, farfu la Selis, la Djein</B></P>
<P>But let us return to giving. Here is the Loglan version of sentence (4):</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(9)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">La Djan, pa donsu leda sorme le cinkau [sheen-KAH-oo]. </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">John gave his sister the puppy (infant-dog).</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/laDJAN.paDONsuledaSORmelecinKAu/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Like (4), (9) is entirely untagged. But now let's tag the three arguments of this sentence and then permute them as we did in the English sentences (5)-(8). The tags we will use were introduced in sentence (3), where we used them without comment. Let's examine the origins of these three particular tags now.</P>
<P>The tag used to mark the Recipient Case in Loglan is <B>dio</B>. <B>Dio</B> is derived from <B>dirco</B> ('direction') which suggests a pointing to something or someone and so serves as an easily remembered cue to the notion of a receiver. The Recipient Case includes, of course, not only receivers but destinations...anything at all toward which things move. The Actor Case is marked by <B>kao</B>, which is similarly derived from <B>kakto</B> ('act'). It includes all sorts of agents, doers and perceivers. The first place of many Loglan predicates--but certainly not of all--are in the Actor Case. The Patient Case, which is used for all parts, passives and properties--of which gifts, because of their passivity, are instances--is marked by <B>beu</B>. <B>Beu</B> is derived from <B>bekti</B> = 'thing', which suggests passivity. Thus the completely tagged form of (9) is</P>

<P>Now the thing to notice from this exercise is that our understanding of these sentences is <EM>not</EM> dependent on their being presented to us in any particular order.

It is this remarkable fact about our "sentence understander"--remarkable, that is, to those of us who speak order-dominated languages like English (it would not surprise an ancient Roman...Latin poetry, for example, apparently exploits the freedom to be disorderly in a most exuberant way)--that makes the optional case system of Loglan workable.

Notice that the case letteral is always the initial letter of the Loglan tag but not always of the case name. We will often use these letterals to tell the reader what case assignments have been given the places of some predicate in which we are interested.

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->

<P>We may expect loglanists to use their optional case system under at least three circumstances: (1) When the argument so-tagged is to be used out of its standard order, as may be desired to preserve the natural word-order in a translation, for example, or for writing poetry, when the freedom of maximum disorder may be desired. (2) When the tagged argument is a fourth or higher-order argument of its predicate. Experience has shown that the meanings of the first three places of even long predicates are easily remembered, but that later arguments--<EM>sufori</EM> ones, as we might say in Loglan--are easily confounded. The habit of routinely tagging the <EM>sufori</EM> arguments of <EM>sufora</EM> predicates prevents this. (3) When the listener is suspected of not knowing the place-structure of some predicate, as is often the case, for example, when the speaker is a teacher and the predicate is still new. In most other circumstances we expect that many loglanists will be charmed, as logicians and mathematicians often are, by the transformational elegance of Loglan's preposition-free forms.</P>
<P>But again we must be prepared to be surprised. The interesting scientific question is, How will the Loglan case tags actually be used? What kinds of users will use them and in what contexts? Again, we have the outcome of an interesting natural experiment to observe.<SUP><A HREF="#note48">48</A></SUP></P>

This same apparatus is available for connecting arguments as well. For just as we can say <B>Da mrenu, e farfu</B>, and mean that <B>Da mrenu</B> and <B>Da farfu</B> are both true, so we can say:</P>

<!-- .H4.32 CONNECTED ARGUMENTS -->
<P>This is the list of connectives we had available at the end of Chapter 3. We can now make several additions, all of which will apply retroactively, as it were, to predicates.</P>
<P>As the expression 'only if' in the English of sentence (5) suggests, we find it awkward to form afterthought implications between arguments in English. It is in any case not nearly so easy to assert this important connection as an afterthought in English as it is in Loglan. But there is another form of implication that is readily asserted between English arguments. Consider the following sentence:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(6)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Raba cluva la Espanias, anoi la Sol </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Each x loves Spain if the Sun.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/rabaCLUvala.esPANias.anoilaSOL/</CENTER></P>

<P>Thus with 'if' and <B>anoi</B> we make exactly the same claim in (6) as we make in (5) with 'only if' and <B>noa</B>; but in (6) the arguments <B>la Espanias</B> and <B>la Sol</B> ('Spain' and 'the Sun') are put in an order that somehow seems more understandable, or at least more convenient, in English.<SUP><A HREF="#note49">49</A></SUP> Now the connection that is made so neatly with English 'if' is called <EM>converse implication</EM>, for it is the same as implication (A implies B) with its terms reversed (B is implied by A). Similarly, the Loglan compound connective <B>anoi</B> is nothing but the converse of the connection made with <B>noa</B>. For if the defining form of <B>noa</B> is <B>no A a B</B>, as we learned in Chapter 3, then all we need to do is switch the terms around to get <B>B a no A</B>. This then provides the defining form of the word for 'if' or <B>anoi</B>. The final vowel -<B>i</B> is necessary in this compound word to keep it from breaking up, so to speak, into the two words <B>a</B> and <B>no</B>. Thus,</P>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(9)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Godzi la Romas, <EM>onoi</EM> la Paris </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Go to Rome <EM>or</EM> Paris, but not to <EM>both</EM>.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/GODzilaROmas.<EM>O</EM>noilapaRIS/</CENTER></P>

<P>The word <B>onoi</B> expresses the "exclusive" sense of English 'or'. This is the sense of 'or' we use when we tell our children that we can go to the mountains or the seaside, but not to both. Since the word <B>onoi</B> is formed on the base <B>o</B>, you may assume that the connection of exclusive 'or' is based on the notion of equivalence even in English...that it is, in short, <EM>negative</EM> equivalence. We can see this best by breaking the word <B>onoi</B> in Sentence (9) into its parts:</P>

<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(10)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Godzi la Romas, o <EM>no</EM> la Paris </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Going to Rome is equivalent to <EM>not</EM> going to Paris.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/GODzilaROmas.o<EM>NO</EM>lapaRIS/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>And in English we would like to add 'and vice versa'. In short, a negative idea (not going to Paris) is said to be equivalent to the positive expression of another idea (going to Rome). Since what equivalence requires is that both its terms be true (not going to Paris and going to Rome) or both false (<EM>not</EM> not going to Paris and not going to Rome, or <EM>going</EM> to Paris but not to Rome), we see that this is exactly what we mean by the exclusive sense of 'or' in English. We shall call this connection <EM>disjunction</EM>, to distinguish it from the inclusive sense of 'or', or alternation.</P>
<P>We may now observe that <B>onoi</B> and <B>anoi</B> are parallel forms. We might think of them as <EM>negative equivalence</EM> and <EM>negative alternation</EM>, respectively. This is true logically in English, but not lexically. For it is impossible to tell from their verbal forms alone that both '...or...but not both' and '...if...' involve an implicit negation of their second terms. You will have to take it on faith that they do, or take a moment to study the generating formulas of the Loglan forms.</P>
<!-- .H4.33 FORETHOUGHT ARGUMENT CONNECTIONS -->
<P>Let us now consider some more transparently negative forms. There are several senses of <EM>negative conjunction</EM> in Loglan. One of them is '...and not...' or <B>enoi</B> [en-noy]; the other is 'not...and...' or <B>noe</B> [no-eh]:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(11)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Godzi la Romas, enoi la Paris. </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Go to Rome but not to Paris.</TD></TR>

<CENTER>/GODzilaROmas.noelapaRIS/</CENTER></P>

<P>The claims of these Loglan compounds are both obvious in English. As usual, they are equivalent respectively to the expanded forms:</P>

<CENTER>/GODzinolaROmas.elapaRIS/</CENTER></P>

<P>But what does <EM>doubly negated conjunction</EM> with <B>noenoi</B> [noh-en-noy] ('not...and not...') actually mean? Does it have a useful meaning? It turns out that it does. This double negation is just what we mean in English by 'neither...nor...':</P>

</P>

<P>And if a doubly negated conjunction is meaningful, what about <EM>doubly negated alternation</EM> with <B>noanoi</B> [noh-ahn-noy] ('either not...or not...and possibly both are false')? This is a rare connection, but we do assert it now and then in English with the expression 'not both...and...are true', or some equivalent phrase:</P>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>There are other compound forms, principally the varieties of independence formed on the base <B>u</B>. But these are less interesting and need not detain us here. The reader is again reminded that the complete connective system may be examined in Appendix B.</P>
<P>We have now defined eleven of the fourteen Loglan connectives in afterthought form: <B>e</B>, <B>noe</B>, <B>enoi</B> and <B>noenoi</B>; <B>a</B>, <B>noa</B>, <B>anoi</B> and <B>noanoi</B>; <B>o</B> and <B>onoi</B>; and finally <B>u</B>. These eleven words form most of the logical connections in Loglan, both between arguments and between predicates. Their <B>c</B>-marked forms (sheks) may even be used to connect predicate words within predicate strings. So, retrospectively, the forms <B>noce cenoi nocenoi</B> [noh-sheh shen-noy noh-shen-noy], <B>canoi nocanoi</B> [shahn-noy noh-shahn-noy], and <B>conoi</B> [shohn-noy] may now be added to the kit of internal connectives <B>ca ce co cu</B> and <B>noca</B> that was introduced in <A HREF="chap3.html#sec3.16">Section 3.16</A>. But all these infixed connective forms have limitations. They cannot be used to express certain complex sequences of connected ideas unambiguously. For example, what does it mean to say 'Bob or John and Pete if Joe were students' in English? We will see in the next section how such riddles are solved in Loglan.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.33">4.33</A> Forethought Argument Connections</H2>


<P>The reader will recall that certain <B>k</B>-marked connections (which we there called keks) were used in the previous chapter to make forethought connections between predicates, i.e., to "kek" them. These were <B>ka ke ko ku</B> and <B>kanoi</B> as derived from the basic set of five afterthought connectives <B>a e o u</B> and <B>noa</B> (often called eks). All the keks were to be positioned before the pair of elements to be connected and the infix <B>ki</B> was to be placed between them. Thus, <B>ka</B>...<B>ki</B>... meant 'either...or...', <B>ke</B>...<B>ki</B>... meant 'both...and...', and <B>kanoi</B>...<B>ki</B>... meant 'if...then...'. (Please note in passing that the phonemically similar ...<B>anoi</B>... is also translated with English 'if'.) Let us now extend this set of five keks by deriving an additional six <B>k</B>-connectives from the six compound eks, namely <B>anoi enoi onoi noe noenoi</B> and <B>noanoi</B>, that were derived in the previous section.</P>
<P>Take <B>anoi</B> = '...if...'. To get the kek that corresponds to <B>anoi</B>, we prefix /k/ to its significant vowel <B>a</B>, getting <B>ka</B>, and then add <B>-noi</B> to the infix <B>ki</B>, getting a new infix <B>kinoi</B>. Thus the whole kek that corresponds to <B>anoi</B> is <B>ka</B>...<B>kinoi</B>.... This makes sense if we remember that the defining form of <B>anoi</B> is ...<B>a no</B>.... Thus <B>ka</B>...<B>kinoi</B>... expresses the same connection as ...<B>a no</B>... does but with the forethought version of the connective. Similarly, the keks for <B>enoi</B> and <B>onoi</B> are <B>ke</B>...<B>kinoi</B>... and <B>ko</B>...<B>kinoi</B>..., both of which also use the new infix <B>kinoi</B>.</P>
<!-- .H4.33 FORETHOUGHT ARGUMENT CONNECTIONS -->
<P>But now let us derive the kek for <B>noe</B> = 'not...but...'. Here the defining form is <B>no</B>...<B>e</B>.... Just as we derived <B>kanoi</B>...<B>ki</B>... ('if... then...') from <B>noa</B> and <B>no</B>...<B>a</B>..., so we will now get <B>kenoi</B>...<B>ki</B>... from <B>no</B>...<B>e</B>.... Similarly, the kek for <B>noenoi</B> will be <B>kenoi</B>...<B>kinoi</B>..., and <B>noanoi</B> gives us the kek <B>kanoi</B>...<B>kinoi</B>.... All these new keks apply retroactively to <A HREF="chap3.html#sec3.18">Section 3.18</A> on kekking predicates, of course, and all these same keks, new and old, may now also be used to kek arguments. For example,</P>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>For, since all unmarked connections are to be interpreted as afterthoughts in Loglan, the listener will group the elements of (4) in the following way:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(4') [(la Djan e la Pit) a la Meris] ditca</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This rule is quite general. <EM>Any</EM> string of unmarked connections in Loglan will group naturally to the left...; or, as we will sometimes say, such strings are <EM>left-associative</EM>. Thus in <B>A e B a C</B> the association must be as (i) [(<B>A e B</B>) <B>a C</B>] and not as (ii) [<B>A e</B> (<B>B a C</B>)]. The reason is that in afterthought mode each new connected element must be connected to a construction that is in some sense already complete. So to get the right-associativity of (ii), one must use a marked connective to embrace the final pair of elements in a group (<B>ka B ki C</B>), and this expression may then be connected as an afterthought to the initial element <B>A</B>. This produces (iii) [<B>A e</B> (<B>ka B ki C</B>)] which has the same right-grouping as (ii); and this is the interpretation of (2) and (5) already given. Indeed, (5) will parse as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(5') [la Djan e (ka la Pit ki la Meris)] ditca</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If now we go back and look at the twice <B>k</B>-connected (2), we see that it, too, will evidently parse as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(2') [ke la Djan ki (ka la Pit ki la Meris)] ditca</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thus both (2) and (5) are right-associated groupings of the same elements and so make the same claim. Evidently kekking the conjunction in (2) was unnecessary. Of the two equivalent forms, the minimally kekked form used in (5) tends to be preferred by loglanists over the one with the unnecessary kek in (2). In general, it is considered good style in Loglan to use unmarked connections when the normal left-associativity of the language accomplishes what is meant, and to kek connections only when the abnormal condition of right-associativity is required.</P>
<P>Let us consider a somewhat longer example of a sentence with unmarked, and therefore left-grouped, connections.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(6) La Bab, a la Djan, e la Pit, anoi la Djos, stude</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>/laBAB.alaDJAN.elaPIT.anoilaDJOS.STUde/</CENTER>

<P>This can only mean '([[Bob or John&gt; and Peter] if Joe) were students' whatever may be the case with similar unmarked strings in English.<SUP><A HREF="#note50">50</A></SUP> If, therefore, we want to express a different grouping pattern than the simple left-associative one which the listener will assume on hearing (6), we must use one or more marked connections. (In the next few examples we will translate <B>ka</B>...<B>kinoi</B>..., which is the marked form of ...<B>anoi</B>... = 'if', with the curiously backward expression 'then...if...'. This is by analogy with 'if...then...' which translates <B>kanoi</B>...<B>ki</B>..., the converse of <B>ka</B>...<B>kinoi</B>.... There is no marked form of '...if...' in English. So we have to invent one to translate the Loglan.) Thus both of the following sentences</P>

<P>are minimally marked. By this I mean that the groupings intended--here shown by parenthesizing the English--cannot be expressed with fewer keks...given this order of elements, anyway. As you may now guess, the most difficult connections to understand are precisely those in which the stylistic sin of unnecessary kekking has been most exuberantly indulged, namely the completely kekked left-associated pattern. For in these, of course, no kekking at all is really necessary. Here is an extreme example of such "bad form":</P>


<P>

</TABLE>
<CENTER>/kakekalaBAB.kilaDJAN.kilaPIT.kinoilaDJOS.STUde/</CENTER>
</P>

<P>Both the English and the Loglan specimens are very nearly incomprehensible (although the parenthesizing does help us glimpse the meaning of the English). But since (9) is equivalent to (6), which is readily comprehensible in both languages, (9) is hardly likely to occur.</P>
<P>In general, then, one uses marked forms for right-associative structures in Loglan, letting the left-associated ones take care of themselves. This avoidance of redundantly marked connections is a little like our reluctance to use the predicate grouping operator <B>ge</B> unnecessarily even though doing so is perfectly grammatical; see <A HREF="chap3.html#sec3.12">Section 3.12</A>.</P>
<P>Here is an example of a sentence which is sparingly kekked in both languages:</P>

<H2><A NAME="sec4.34">4.34</A> Negative Arguments</H2>


<P>In the two previous sections we used negative arguments without comment in such sentences as:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(1)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Mi pa godzi la Romas, e no la Paris</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">I went to Rome and not to Paris.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/mipaGODzilaROMas.enolapaRIS/</CENTER></P>

<P>The advantage of using <B>no</B> in such positions is that it allows us to express two related claims economically in the same sentence. But how are we to interpret <B>no</B> before arguments in sentences which have no connectives? Consider the following sentence:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(2)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Mi pa godzi no la Paris </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">I went not to Paris.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/mipaGODzi.nolapaRIS/</CENTER></P>

<P>Clearly this is one of the two sentences (the other being <B>Mi pa godzi la Romas</B>) which have been implicitly connected to form the compound claim of sentence (1), the legitimacy of which we have already accepted. We are plainly obliged to accept its constituent (2) as a grammatical form as well. Yet the English version of sentence (2) has a curiously archaic ring. When we revive this archaism in Loglan we do so to obtain certain transformational advantages, not the least of which is the disentangling of just such negative connections as occur in (1). There are other advantages, but before considering them let us first be clear what <B>no</B> means before argument terms. Consider the next three sentences:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(3)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">No la Paris, pa nu godzi mi </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Not Paris was gone to by me.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/nolapaRIS.panuGODzimi/</CENTER></P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(4)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">No, la Paris, pa nu godzi mi </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">It is not the case that Paris was gone to by me.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/NO.lapaRIS.panuGODzimi/</CENTER></P>

<!-- .H4.34 NEGATIVE ARGUMENTS -->
<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(5)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">No, mi pa godzi la Paris </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">It is not the case that I went to Paris.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/NO.mipaGODzilapaRIS/</CENTER></P>

<P>Sentence (3) is obviously the converse of sentence (2), the one in which we first found the argument <B>la Paris</B> negated. In (3) we brought the negative argument to the head of the sentence. Sentence (4) is evidently a permissible transform of (3) in which the scope of the negation has been extended to the whole sentence. Evidently this can be done simply by pausing after the now-initial <B>No</B>.<SUP><A HREF="#rnote11">R11</A></SUP> Sentence (5) is apparently a reconversion of (4) back into the original order of arguments as they appeared in sentence (2) but with the negative <B>no</B> left at the head of the sentence. Are we justified in doing this?</P>
<P>By the rule of conversion given in Section 3.l8 it is clear that (3) makes the same claim as (2),<SUP><A HREF="#note52">52</A></SUP> although with the different emphasis expressed by the new order in which the arguments <B>la Paris</B> and <B>mi</B> now appear. But the interesting thing is that <B>no</B>, which has accompanied <B>la Paris</B> in its migration to the position of first argument in sentence (3), has now turned up at the head of the sentence. In this new position we may recognize <B>No</B> as a potential modifier of the entire sentence, and turn it into one simply by pausing after it and generating sentence (4), which is evidently what <B>No</B> was implicitly before. In (4), <B>No</B> with its following pause now has the sense of contradicting the whole sentence. So we may translate the <B>No</B>-comma sequence in sentence (4) by that curious phrase 'It is not the case that' which occurs so frequently in the argot of logicians. Such phrases occur only rarely in everyday speech and then mainly in argument ('That's not so!') and often very awkwardly ('What you said when you said that John came to dinner just isn't true!'). The truth is that the Indo-European languages have no simple operator by which unequivocal contradictories of given sentences may be formed.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>But in Loglan we need one. Sentence (5), which is the reconversion of (4), shows that <B>no</B> before at least some kinds of arguments has this sense of the sentential contradictor ('It is not the case that'); and the transformation rule by which we can always get from sentences of type (2) to sentences of type (5)--without bothering to go through such intermediate forms as (3) and (4)--is called the "rule of exportation." We may now state this rule explicitly<!--was explicity-->: <B>No</B> before designative arguments may always be exported to the head of the sentence.<SUP><A HREF="#note53">53</A></SUP></P>
<P>But negatives before non-designative arguments may <EM>not</EM> be so easily exported. Suppose we wish to claim that some people are not fathers using the non-designating variables of <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.21">Section 4.21</A>:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(6)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">Ba farfu no be </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">Something x is the father of no something y.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/baFARfunobe/</CENTER></P>

<P>If, now, we export this <B>no</B> to the head of the sentence we get:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(7)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">No, ba farfu be </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">It is not the case that something x is the father of something y.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/NO.baFARfube/</CENTER></P>

<P>which means <EM>no</EM> one is a father. This is not what we intend. Evidently the easy transformation leading by double conversion from sentence (2) to sentence (5) is not applicable to sentences with non-designating variables. Let us see why.</P>
<P>Suppose we try to convert the predicate of sentence (6) as follows:</P>

<P><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">(8)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="50%">No be nu farfu ba </TD><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="45%">No something y is fathered by something x.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<CENTER>/nobenuFARfuba/</CENTER></P>

<P>But this means that no one <EM>has</EM> a father! Evidently we are not allowed to convert predicates with non-designative arguments. To do so would clearly be to change their meanings.<SUP><A HREF="#note54">54</A></SUP></P>
<P>The reason is that every non-designating variable is an implicit sentence quantifier--which is a matter we will take up in Chapter 5 when we consider quantified sentences--and the order of these quantifiers is often very important in logic. Conversion changes their order, sometimes illegitimately. Suppose, for example, we rewrite the English portions of sentences (6) and (8) in the style of English speech that is favored by logicians. Sentence (6) then becomes</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(9) There is an x such that there is no y such that x is the father of y.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>or, less tediously, at least one x is not a father. Sentence (8) becomes</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(10) There is no y such that there is an x such that x is the father of y.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Or no one has a father. But the only difference between (9) and (10) is the order of the quantifying expressions 'there is an x such that' and 'there is no y such that'. Evidently the order in which such quantifications are applied to the same basic sentence makes some difference to those operations of the human mind that collectively we call logic.</P>
<!-- .H4.34 NEGATIVE ARGUMENTS -->
<P>If, now, we examine the Loglan sentences of (6) and (8) more closely, we see that the order of appearance of the non-designative arguments <B>ba</B> and <B>no be</B> differs in these two sentences in a way that exactly reflects the order of the explicit quantifying expressions in their English translations as sentences (9) and (10). Moreover the negative part of the argument <B>no be</B> is, in a sense, "stuck to" its variable: it may be transformed but it may not be simply moved. The difference in meaning, then, between (6) and (8) inheres essentially in the order of these arguments. So they may not be converted without changing that meaning.<!-- There will be more on the handling of implicit quantifiers in A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.17"Section 5.17/A.--></P>

<P>Before leaving the matter of negative arguments, let us go back and qualify something we said about negative predicates in <A HREF="chap3.html#sec3.9">Section 3.9</A>. We said there that if the negative <B>no</B> applied to the entire predicate expression--as it does in <B>Da no pa gudbi mrenu</B>--it could be moved to the head of the sentence without changing the claim of that sentence. And so it may, if the sentence contains no non-designating variables or indefinite descriptions...objects we had not then encountered. Thus, because <B>Da no pa gudbi mrenu</B> ('X was not a good man') is a complete sentence (<B>mrenu</B> is one-place) it does not, therefore, even implicitly contain non-designating variables. The predicate negative may, therefore, be exported without changing its claim: <B>No, da pa gudbi mrenu</B> = 'It is not the case that X was a good man.' But suppose we alter the sentence so that it contains the non-designating variable <B>ba</B> in place of the designating variable <B>da</B>:</P>

<P>This is clearly a difference to which every language must attend. In Loglan we attend to them by assigning difference in meaning to different orders of the same small set of words (<B>ba</B>, <B>no</B>, <B>ra</B>, etc.). In English these matters are attended to with a host of different pronomial words and expressions ('nothing', 'no one', 'everything', 'something', 'some', 'none', etc.) as well as by strict rules governing the interpretation of each order: 'Nothing is related to everything' vs. 'Everything is related to nothing.' In both languages negatives tend to be "stuck to" their arguments if that argument is a non-designating word.</P>
<P>The most important thing we have learned in this section is that negatives before arguments may be exported to the head of the sentence if and only if those arguments are of the designating kind. Incidentally we have also learned that negatives before predicates may also be transported to the head of the sentence if and only if that sentence as a whole contains no non-designating arguments such as non-designating variables or indefinite descriptions.<SUP><A HREF="#note55">55</A></SUP> This restriction is broader than it sounds. We have already noted (<A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.30">Section 4.30</A>, Note 36) that every incomplete sentence implicitly contains a non- designating variable: an existential if the predicate is positive, a universal if it is negative. Thus the innocent claim <B>Da corta</B> ('X is short') implicitly contains the minimal claim that X is shorter than something (<B>Da corta ba</B>) but the negative claim, <B>Da no corta</B>, is really quite extravagant<!--was extravagent-->, meaning as it does that X is non-shorter than, i.e., longer than or equal to, literally everything there is (<B>Da no corta raba</B>). From this sentence we may <EM>not</EM> export the negative, as in <B>No da corta raba</B> = 'It is not the case that X is shorter than every something x', for to do so produces the absurd result that the X that was once claimed to be among the longest things in the world is now satisfied to be anything but the shortest.</P>
<P>The handling of negatives is evidently fairly important in a logical language. We shall complete our discussion of Loglan negatives in <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.26">Section 5.26<!--was 5.25--></A> on negative sentences.</P>



<H2><A NAME="sec4.35">4.35</A> Mixed Arguments with <B>ze</B></H2>

<P>Just as we may say <B>Da pa dzoru ze prano</B> ('X walked-and-ran') and mean something quite different by it from <B>Da pa dzoru, e prano</B>, so we can form mixed arguments in Loglan with the same mixing operator <B>ze</B>. The distinction between mixed and connected argument forms need not puzzle us long. It is exactly the same distinction we have already encountered between quantified descriptions made with <B>le</B> and those made with <B>lo</B> in Loglan.

</P>

<P>For in both (1) and (3) we are talking about two independent events, both of which we assert to be true. Evidently they painted it at different times. Either that or they painted it at the same time while trying to avoid each other's brushes, for each is obliged to paint the whole house if sentences (1) and (3) are both to be true. Sentences (2) and (4) are more sensible. John and Pete now evidently constitute a team, and jointly, by dividing the work, they got it painted. From neither of these last two sentences can we legitimately infer that either of them painted the house.</P>
<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P>While the distinction between mixed and connected arguments is now plain to us--for we have learned to see it as potential speakers of Loglan--it is surprising how frequently the unmodified word 'and' is used in English to report a <!--mixed -->designation of a set<!--added 'of a set'--> and not a true connection at all. Thus all the following sentences almost undoubtedly contain pairs of arguments that the typical English speaker would intend to be regarded as a single designation of something composed of several parts: 'John and Mary own their own house', 'Joe and Sally are good at mixed doubles', 'Roger and Carl went downtown', 'He sold the horse and saddle to the boy.' In every case the most usual interpretation of the word 'and' would certainly be that it formed a lump of two things which, taken together (e.g., 'the horse-and-saddle'), behaved in a certain way (e.g., was sold in a single transaction). But note that this way does not necessarily, or even very frequently, characterize the two things taken separately. Thus Joe may <EM>not</EM> be good at mixed doubles when he is teamed with anyone but Sally.</P>
<P>The truth is that while the English phrase '...and jointly...' <EM>can</EM> be used to replace 'and' in each of these sentences, it does not occur to the ordinary English mind to do so. For the metaphysical orientation of English suggests no such distinction. Therefore the word 'and' does not really mean <B>e</B> in Loglan; nor does it mean <B>ze</B>. Instead it means some curious unresolved blending of the ideas of connection and mixture which are in Loglan utterly distinct. Just what this idea is, would be hard to describe. But it is probably a mistake to think that the Loglan distinction is implicit in English. It can be made, and some careful English speakers do sometimes make it; but it is evidently not natural in English to think about the differences between lumps of things and sets.</P>
<P>But we have seen in this chapter that in Loglan the distinction between lumps or masses of things, on the one hand, and two or more individual<!--was particular--> things of which some same thing may be true<!--added "of which...true"--> or sets of things, on the other, is the most fundamental distinction in the Loglan grammar of arguments. And we have just now seen that the fundamental operation underlying this distinction is the connection of arguments with <B>e</B> as opposed to their consolidation into sets<!--was lumps--> and teams with <B>ze</B>. Then by repeated applications of this set-forming<!--was mixing--> operation with <B>ze</B><!--added "with ze"-->we arrive eventually at a single designation of all the butter there is. And this is exactly what we mean by <B>lea<!--was lo--> batra</B>. We then see that the distinction between <B>lea<!--was lo--> batra</B> and <B>ra<!--was le--> batra</B> can be logically generated for every predicate in the language. In doing so, we become systematically alert to a very important matter that is only dimly felt in the natural languages. Are we talking about sets? Or about <!---->individuals who happen to share some property?<!--was lumps.--> This distinction is implicit in English at just one point: in the difference between the grammatical treatment of its mass and collective<!--added "and collective"--> nouns, like 'butter' and 'team<!--was water-->', and its countable nouns, like 'men' and 'books'. In Loglan this important distinction is fully generalized, and is available to us whenever we talk or think.</P>
<!-- .H4 NOTES -->
<P>Again we see how Loglan metaphysics is sharply different from that of English...indeed, from the metaphysical assumptions of all the natural tongues. For the Loglan world starts with pieces of butter and bits of better-than, and by successive applications of the machinery of abstraction and set<!--added set--> description, all the elementary predicate notions of the language can be raised to any level of conceptual intricacy that we desire. At the highest levels are such familiar individuals as virtue and butter. But they are joined, in the Loglan view of things, by such surprising abstract entities as "butterness," "bookness", <!--and -->"enoughth-ness<!--.-->", and "the set of all the burrowing owls."<!--added 'and "the...owls."--> Thus the Loglan world of individuals is a larger world than is commonly accessible to the natural tongues, for it accommodates by vastly exceeding the old. What this may finally mean for the observing eye and the thinking mind can only be guessed. But one thing is certain. For any given size of vocabulary, there will be more in Loglan to think about.</P>



<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="name">Notes</A></H2>

<P><A NAME="note1">1</A> Throughout this chapter I will use the word 'designate' in the approximate sense of 'purport to name, identify, or single out', a sense that does not entirely accord with either philosophic or linguistic usage (cf. Morris 1946, Carnap 1948, Ziff 1960, Quine 1961a). I do this because there is no well-established single word in English that permits one to refer to just this species of linguistic behavior, and I need to. For in the system of semantics I am about to develop, the act of "designation" contrasts with that of "predication," and both are ways of referring to the "external", i.e., non-linguistical, world. In adopting this terminological scheme, I am closest, among logicians, to the analyses if not the usages of Quine. The distinction he draws between "singular" terms and "general" ones, i.e., between that which purports to name X, and that which is true of X (see Quine 1961a:205ff), is very nearly what I take to be the distinction between designating and predicating, though my emphasis is naturally a different one. (For example, I do not think, as Quine does, that the former activity can be eliminated in favor of the latter.) Both acts refer; we would agree on that. But that they do so in entirely different ways is the main point of this chapter. Morris and Carnap, in contrast, use 'designate' in approximately my sense of 'refer'; Ziff uses 'refer' in approximately my sense of 'designate'; some writers use 'denote' where I use 'designate'; others use 'designate' where I use 'predicate'. Still others call predicates "names." And the names of what? Why, of "properties", of course. In short, semantical terminology is in something of a muddle. There is more on this matter in Chapter 8 of <CITE>Loglan 2</CITE> (Brown 1969b).</P>

<P><A NAME="note4">4</A> More than suffice, evidently. As mentioned in the text, experience has suggested that any three among the replacing variables, for example, <B>da de do</B>, can be assigned and kept track of in this "LIFO" way ("Last In, First Out"), but that assigning more than three in the course of speech is probably too much for the human temporary memory. Usage has added two new conventions since 1975 which supplement the <B>da de di do du</B> system. The first is to use an identifying clause on the first use of a fourth or later replacing variable, e.g., <B>di ji la Pit</B> = 'Y, who is Pete', a practice which allows one to ignore order of occurrence. The second is to use the letter variables discussed in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.6">Section 4.6</A> as abbreviations, e.g., to use <B>fei</B> (<B>f</B>) to replace <B>le fumna</B>, whenever the context gets too complicated for the <B>da de di do du</B> system to handle. Indeed, the use of letter variables already seems to be so problem-free as to suggest that it may supplant the free variable system entirely. Both systems are still optional. The learner may use either or both. Again we will "let usage decide".</P>

<P><A NAME="note5">5</A> As remarked in <A HREF="chap3.html#note3">Chapter 3, Note 3</A>, Loglan has a grammar which is in many respects like those of the natural pidgins and creoles.

<P><A NAME="note7">7</A> The anaphoric use of letter variables was first suggested by Stephen Smith on a visit to The Institute in 1979.</P>

<P><A NAME="note8">8</A> The logical theory of descriptions, following Russell (1905), gives a slightly different account of these matters, namely that the description '(i)Fx' purports to name (i.e., designate) the one and only object of which 'F' is true, 'F' being some predicate expression which allows this interpretation, e.g., 'is an author of Waverly' (see, for example, Quine 1961a:222). On this interpretation 'the author of Waverly' (Russell's classic example) is taken to contain the covert claim 'There is an x such that x is an author of Waverly and, for any y, if y is an author of Waverly, then y is identical to x.' But the uniqueness claim is patently false for the majority of expressions commencing with 'the' in everyday speech, e.g., 'the man', 'the red thing', etc. What <EM>is</EM> common to all such expressions is the intention of the speaker to single out however crudely (e.g. 'the whachamacallit') the unique object, or set of objects, about which da has something to say. That such expressions <EM>use</EM> predicates is apparently misleading, for they do not use them predicatively; any more than names used vocatively actually name. On the view taken in this book, no claim whatever is made by a description. What is signified by the use of one is (among other things) the speaker's readiness to help the listener locate the unique object about which da has something to say. We may say that this <EM>implies</EM> that da believes that such objects exist, but this is a different matter. No one may be accused of claiming everything that da's words imply. There is more on this in <CITE>Loglan 2</CITE>, Chapter 8 (Brown 1969b, reprinted in <CITE>TL2</CITE>:31-41).</P>

This one is grammatical, i.e., the utterance will parse; but it will not parse in this way.</P>

<P><A NAME="note10">10</A> This intimate glimpse of the machine's rather fussy parsing behavior is probably nothing that human users of the language need to worry about...unless they aspire to be Loglan grammarians. We frankly doubt that descriptions like that in (8) will have much currency in human Loglan. It is, after all, an exception to the general analogical rule that "Whatever works in one context should work in another." The converse rule "Whatever doesn't work in one context is probably not worth trying in others" is probably also built into human grammar learning behavior. So unless we are <EM>taught</EM> by machines to make sentences like (8) it is unlikely that human users will ever try to make them...knowing, as they surely will, that sentences intended to parse like (7') always fail. Analogical rules like the one defeated here may, in fact, be quite generally invoked in human grammar learning. If they are, they are probably responsible for a great deal of the syntactic ambiguity in natural language. Scott W. Layson is responsible for this particular bit of grammar programming. It was done during the first, 1978-82 assault on the "macgrammatical mountain", the one that resulted in <CITE>Notebook 1</CITE> (Brown 1982a). Its purpose was to make these unambiguous sentences machine intelligible...whether humans would ever be tempted to use them or not. An interesting scientific question raised by this particular provision of Loglan grammar is whether the analogical rule by which the use of new grammatical structures is extended from one context to another--sometimes leaving a trail of new ambiguities in its wake--is hard-wired in the human central nervous system or not? With Loglan, language scientists should be able to tease answers to such important questions out.</P>

<P><A NAME="note11">11</A> This discussion of the mass term owes much to Quine (1960) in which he makes ingenious use of the distinction between mass terms and general terms in discussing certain philosophical difficulties in the way of coming to understand totally unknown languages. In particular, Quine examines the difficulty that will be experienced by a philosophically wary investigator--one who has presented a series of different rabbits, say, to a certain informant--in deciding whether that informant's uniform linguistic response to this series of stimuli means that da's language has a general term for 'rabbit', of which da recognized each new rabbit as an instance, or whether da's language 
<!-- .H4 NOTES -->
has only a mass term, roughly equivalent to 'Mr. Rabbit', say, of the designatum of which da recognizes in each presentation simply a reappearance. Quine shows that the resolution of this difficulty involves linguistic transformations of a surprisingly high logical order; and that these, in turn, involve ontological assumptions about the language in question which one would have hoped to be among the findings, rather than the presuppositions, of linguistic inquiry. My own reflections on this matter persuade me that in the mass term/general term distinction we are probably dealing with a fundamental biological feature of the human speech apparatus...differently exploited in learning different languages, to be sure, but always there. For example, my own observations of the speech behavior of very young (pre-English speaking) children suggests that the mass term may be developmentally the earliest semantic mechanism to appear in human speech behavior--far earlier, for example, than the mastery of the detailed use of mass terms as a special class of nouns in English--and that it is, therefore, the meaning of the <EM>general</EM> term that is ontogenetically secondary in the biological development of the human semantic scheme. Goodman (1951) also discusses the "arbitrary" ways in which the primitive predicate may be invested with meaning under a wide variety of ontological schemes. On this view, the basic semantic mechanism of Loglan could have been a Trobriand-style 'X is a manifestation of Mr. Y.' type of predicate relation rather than the, to us, "simpler" semantic relation between designations of particular concrete individuals and some general term ('X is an instance of Y'). The same considerations apply to the difference between "abstract" and "concrete" predicate meanings. Thus we could have invested the unadorned Loglan predicate with the abstract meaning that is in fact its meaning now with <B>po</B> and <B>pu</B>. The concrete particular meaning we now hold simple would in that case be derived from some grammatically complex operation on the linguistically "simpler" notion of an event or quality. Such hypothetical languages are fascinating to contemplate; but the choice among them may be more than a pragmatic one, and actually turn out to be partly rooted in some intractable streak of Nature that, by evolving us to do so, "insists" that we first regard her from some particular, favored side. For the mechanism of that "insistence" could, of course, only be the evolution of the rewarding apparatus in language-using animals so as to favor just that side. There is more on the <B>lo</B> operator and its ontological implications in Brown (1977a).</P>

Thus, a pair of horror quotes (double-quotes in my idiolect) appears around the word 'horror' in the preceding sentence, while a genuinely designative use of (single) quotes appears around the same word in this one. To perform the notice-serving function of quotation marks in English, there is another operator, namely the metaphorizer <B>jo</B>, which has the function of marking figurative expressions, especially on the first occasion of their use in some passage or discourse; for more on <B>jo</B> and kin, see <CITE>Loglan 6</CITE>.</P>

<P><A NAME="note15">15</A> The appeal of nonsense to logicians is curiously widespread and in some cases monumental (for example, in Lewis Carroll). The affinity is not accidental.

<P><A NAME="note17">17</A> Or at least they are in all languages of which we know; but see Note 11, above, for considerations which argue the logical possibility of languages in which such abstract mass individuals are the elementary objects of the linguistic scheme, and hence elementary to just such hypothetical "minds" as had been exclusively exposed to such languages. Whether <EM>human</EM> minds would react in this way to such exposure is, of course, a biological question of some interest.</P>

<P><A NAME="note18">18</A> Quine (1958) offers an interesting conjecture as to how abstract singular terms might originate by analogy with concrete ones as a solution to one of the ontological problems of the child. Supposing (as seems likely) that children commence their linguistic careers with an ontology, i.e., a view of existence, which sees the world as composed of mass individuals and their reappearances (Mummy, Hunger, Warmth, and the like), and graduate to countable objects and general terms (boys, dogs, glasses of water, and the like); there would then emerge the ontological problem of what kind of individuals "stand behind" those general terms which have spotty, streaky or superficial manifestations, like 'is red'. For a red thing is not red clean through, as a boy is a boy clean through and as every drop of water is wet. Quine suggests, therefore, that on analogy with some word like 'water', which survives ontologically as the mass individual Mr. Water lurking behind the predicate 'is water', a new individual Mr. Red is mistakenly conjured up to be the simple, concrete massification of the predicate 'is red'. Mistakenly, because in fact the mass individual composed of all red things is <EM>not</EM> all red, as water is all water, but mostly white (apples), pink (Injuns), green (plums), and so on; and of course the child knows this. So what the child really means to designate by the mass term 'red', in such sentences as 'Red is my favorite color', is not the same kind of mass individual da alludes to in 'Water is my favorite drink.' Instead, it is the <EM>abstract</EM> mass individual composed of all the red parts, spots, or streaks of red by virtue of which red things are red, the same individual we designate in Loglan with <B>lopu redro</B>. Hence attributes arise on the basis of a false analogy; and red becomes as "pure" and "liquid" a thing as water is, though oddly less substantial, by virtue of the shifting ontological scenery in the child's mind.</P>

<!-- .H4 NOTES -->
<P><A NAME="note19">19</A> Another clarifying provision is the pause rule that distinguishes the compound operator <B>lepo</B> and kin from the corresponding phrases <B>le po</B> and kin with which they might sometimes be confused. <B>Le po</B> phrases are rare but when they do occur are always distinguished by internal pauses which <B>lepo</B> and kin never show. For example, the phrase <B>le po</B> in (i) <B>le po sucmi ditca</B> = 'the swimming teacher (i.e., a teacher of the activity of swimming)' is always pronounced with a pause between the <B>le</B> and the <B>po</B>, and, in addition, the <B>le</B> is often stressed. Thus /LE.poSUCmiDITca/ is a typical utterance of (i). In contrast, both syllables of the word <B>lepo</B> are usually unstressed and there is never a pause between them. The utterance /lepoSUCmiDITca/ therefore uniquely resolves as (ii) <B>lepo sucmi ditca</B> = '(the state of) being a swim(mer) teacher, i.e., a teacher of swimmers', which is a much more common way of speaking in Loglan. Expressions like (i) are said to involve <EM>short-scope</EM> <B>po</B>, for in them, the force of abstraction extends over exactly one predicate, the next predicate word. Expressions like (ii) are said to involve <EM>long-scope</EM> <B>-po</B>, for in them the force of the abstraction runs over the entire sentence serving as the operand of the event description. When short-scope <B>po</B> occurs non-initially in a predicate string, as in (iii) <B>le corta po sucmi ditca</B> = 'The short swimming-event teacher' (i.e. a teacher of swimming-events of short duration), no pause is required: /leCORtapoSUCmiDITca/. It is only when short-scope <B>po</B> follows a descriptor that it needs to be set off from that descriptor by an intervening pause. Other stress patterns than those described here are, of course, quite permissible.</P>

MRH in 2017:  as we generally do, we preserve JCB's note, but the situation has changed.  The phonetic shape of the short-scope versions of <B>po, pu, zo</B> has changed to <B>poi, pui, zoi</B> (these words could be used for some of the examples of abstract predicates in the text).  There are no <B>lepo</B> words:  the presence or absence of a pause makes no difference.  <B>le po sucmi ditca</B> or <B>le, po sucmi ditca</B> both mean "the swimming lesson", while <B>le poi sucmi ditca</B> means "the swimming teacher".  One could also say <B>le ge po sucmi guo ditca</B> for "the swimming teacher", but this is too elaborate:  the reason for the <B>ge</B> may be explained later.

<P><A NAME="note20">20</A> This move may have some bearing on the phenomenon that Quine calls "referential opacity" (1961b:139ff). For example, when recast with a Loglan-like event-description the troublesome sentence 'Philip believes that the capital of Honduras is in Nicaragua' (p.141) becomes 'Philip believes that the state of affairs of the capital of Honduras being in Nicaragua obtains.' This second formulation relieves Philip of the responsibility of ever having listened to, or uttered, such a remark, and yet clearly designates the non- existent object in which Philip believes. How different this is from a third formulation: 'Philip believes that the sentence 'The capital of Honduras is in Nicaragua' is true.'! About this third sentence, we should certainly agree with Quine that its deduction from 'Philip believes that the sentence 'Tegucigalpa is in Nicaragua' is true' and the true identity 'Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras' is not justified. But contexts within quotation marks are always and everywhere referentially opaque. But are descriptions always similarly opaque? Clearly not. For 'the village ten miles north of Tegucigalpa' and 'the village ten miles north of the capital of Honduras' both succeed, for a person in possession of this identity, in designating the same presumably existent thing. The difficulty that is residual in Philip's believing in the object we have designated 'the state of affairs of the capital of Honduras being in Nicaragua' is that it is non-existent; and how indeed do we locate such objects for the sake of testing the truth of sentences in which their designations occur? This is, of course another and a quite different problem; but certainly it is not incapable of solution. For how <EM>do</EM> we determine whether or not Philip believes in the flatness of the Earth, or in the flights of Pegasus? We ask him; and in doing so we do not have first to locate a flat Earth or a winged horse to present to him; for a picture or a model, or even a carefully constructed sentence delineating this non-existent thing, will clearly do for ascertaining the truth or falsity of any claim that da believes in it.</P>

<P><A NAME="note21">21</A> For humans. The <B>ga</B>-rule is not awkward for machines. The machine grammar sees <B>ga</B> as just another allolex of the PA Lexeme. Machines will observe that human speakers evidently use it when they have no particular time or place or mode in mind but want to mark their predicate expressions anyway. (The motive of the mark-using speaker may remain unknown to the machine.) The machine would not regard the use of <B>ga</B> when contextually unnecessary as ungrammatical, or even odd. Thus, <B>*Da ga mrenu</B> is a perfectly grammatical expression to the machine. (If you have LIP--the "Loglan Interactive Parser"--try it. It will parse. But I have starred it because it is bad usage...from the point of view of human users of the language.) That in fact human speakers, being sensitive to such matters, do not produce such unnecessarily marked sentences is a distributional matter, a matter of usage, not grammar. Machines may remain context-insensitive, in short, and still parse the productions of context-sensitive human beings. When our machines begin to speak Loglan back to us, we may of course <EM>then</EM> teach them whatever humanoid practices we wish them to observe. When we do that, we will perforce be teaching them a kind of context-sensitivity. For in a certain sense all usages are context-sensitive in that they are selected by the user as appropriate to the contexts in which they are to appear.</P>

<P><A NAME="note22">22</A> The noun/verb distinction does this work in English, as in all the Indo-European languages. Thus the distinction made with various English suffixes between the description 'the man singer' and the sentence 'The man sings' is made in Loglan by the presence or absence of the predicate marker <B>ga</B>: <B>Le mrenu gritu</B> vs. <B>Le mrenu ga gritu</B>. From this and similar experiments it emerges that the chief syntactical work of the noun-verb and adjective-verb distinctions in the natural languages may be to distinguish the predicative from the designative parts of sentences. The PA operators and the LE and NI operators do this work in Loglan, and, as in <B>Da preda</B>, they may be omitted when no ambiguity can arise.</P>

<P><A NAME="note27">27</A> There is more on the quantification privileges of various kinds of descriptions in Rosenberger (1978) and Brown (1979c).</P>

<P><A NAME="note28">28</A> Indefinite description has had a checkered history in Loglan. The first widely published account of the language, the 1960 <CITE>Scientific American</CITE> article (Brown 1960), included a provision for speaking universals and existentials by indefinite description much as is here described. But six years later this option had already been removed from the language. It had been replaced in Brown (1966), the first book on the language and the 1st Edition of this one, by the requirement that the quantificational machinery of modern logic <EM>always</EM> be used. The latter option had been present in 1960 but was not obligatory. So, as early as 1966, expressions such as <B>Ra humni ga razdou</B> had been outlawed and were to be replaced by expressions like <B>Raba humni, noa razdou</B> ('Every something x is human only if it reasons'). (The latter sentence is still good Loglan and its construction will be explained in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.30">Section 4.30</A>.) Indefinite description reappeared after a 21-year absence in <CITE>Notebook 3</CITE> (Brown 1987). My reasons for reinstalling it were three-fold: (1) Learners whose native languages include indefinite articles used the corresponding Loglan words (<B>su</B> and <B>ne</B>) in indefinite descriptions anyway, whether it was "grammatical" for them to do so or not. (2) Translating natural language texts that contained indefinite articles into a style of Loglan that eschewed them often imposed an alien formality on those texts. Without indefinite description, the translater had to render all instances of existential and universal claims by the heavily logical- ized Loglan forms. For example, da would have to replace every genuinely existential 'a' in an English text with a <B>ba jio</B>-clause ('something x which is a...') and every 'all' with <B>raba</B>...<B>noa</B> ('every something x is...only if...'). Such a requirement, if adhered to, would certainly mar Loglan's performance as a translation instrument. But (3) quite the most important consideration was the fact that Loglan had become, since 1975, a language of optionalities. It is fair to say that Loglan is now not so much a <EM>logical</EM> language as one in which the <EM>option</EM> of "talking logic" elegantly and swiftly is available to the speaker should da wish to use it. Moreover, logicality-alogicality is not the only pair of stylistic choices now built into the language. There has always been the optionality of its tense system, for example; and there are now optional case tags. Yet the existence of a system of case-tags (which may be found in <A HREF="chap4.html#sec4.31">Section 4.31</A>) in no way interferes with the basic caselessness of the unadorned Loglan argument. This, like the equally basic tenselessness of its unadorned predicates, remains as it was before the case option was added. I believe (but cannot of course yet know) that the logicality function will be similarly unimpaired by the side-by-side existence of pre-logical linguistic forms. Besides, each option-pair is, in effect, a provision for running a natural experiment. The existence of the fully logicalized but nevertheless speakable <B>ba</B> and <B>raba</B> forms alongside the evolutionarily older, and hence more natural, <B>su</B> and <B>ra</B> forms will provide for just one more such experiment, in this case a vital one for the Whorf hypothesis. Does the use in speech of logicalized verbal forms, like the predicate calculus, facilitate the thinking of the speakers? Or hinder it? Who chooses to use these logical devices? Under what circumstances? We would like to know. With a fully optionalized experimental language such as Loglan now is, it ought to be possible to find out.</P>

<P><A NAME="note29">29</A> The use of the syllable /ra/ as the quantifier word meaning 'all' and also as the numerical suffix meaning '-some' or '-ad' may seem to introduce homonyms into the language. But the grammar is so arranged that these two uses of the same syllable will never be confused. For example, the word <B>ra</B> can never follow a number word; so if /ra/ is heard after a number word it is not the word <B>ra</B> but the suffix -<B>ra</B> one is hearing. Semantically, the two uses of /ra/ are related. The cardinal number of a set is found by counting <EM>all</EM> its members.</P>

<P><A NAME="note30">30</A> Alternatively this could be said by first making the complex predicate <B>fergalno</B> from <B>fe + r + galno</B>; whence <B>Ta fergalno veslo</B> = 'That's a five-gallon container.'

Please note my note <A HREF="#rnote10">R10</A> below.<p>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P><A NAME="note36">36</A> Note that <B>Ba pa ditka mi lemi barma</B> ('Something bit me on my arm') makes the same claim completely as the incomplete form <B>Mi pa nu ditka</B> ('I was bitten') makes, and that this last statement contains no reference to the biter at all. But in fact all incomplete forms of multiplace positive predicates implicitly claim the existence of at least one whole set of participants in the predicated relationship even though some of them remain unmentioned. Thus <B>Mi vedma</B> ('I sell') is, strictly speaking, an abbreviation of <B>Mi vedma ba be bo</B> ('I sell something to someone for something') and may be so expanded when desired. Sentences with <EM>negative</EM> predicates, on the other hand, require universally quantified non-designating variables for their completion; see Note 37 below. Thus <B>Mi no vedma</B> becomes <B>Mi no vedma raba rabe rabo</B> ('I do not sell anything to anyone at any price'); see <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.25">Section 5.25</A> on negative sentences for further discussion of this point.</P>

<P><A NAME="note37">37</A> The logician will miss the existential quantifier in these expressions. In the language of logicians (1) would normally be rendered '(Ex)Fxy', in which '(Ex)' is the existential quantifier and may be read 'There is an x such that'; (2) by '(Ex)(Ey)Fxy'; and so on; for example as in the notation of Quine (1961). If we really are to "talk symbolic logic" in speaking Loglan, why not follow this well-established linguistic route? But Loglan is a spoken language, not a notation meant for visual inspection, nor yet a way of reading notational expressions aloud; for surely this is the origin of the logician's version of spoken English. In every spoken language the most frequently used expressions have the briefest forms, and the existential claim is surely one of the most frequently used devices in the natural languages...more frequent, for example, than universals. We should expect this rule to hold in Loglan, too. Therefore we set aside a series of "non-designating" variables to be used exclusively with quantified sentences in Loglan and say that any unquantified instance of such a variable implicitly expresses the existential claim, while any instance of such a variable preceded by the quantifier <B>ra</B> ('all') implicitly expresses the universal claim; there is more on the Loglan system of implicit quantification in <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.24">Section 5.24</A> on quantified sentences.</P>

<!-- .H NOTES -->
<P><A NAME="note38">38</A> Logicians, but not other people, are likely to feel that this sentence requires explicit mention of an existential quantifier with sentence-long scope, as in schema (i) '(Ex)(Fx &middot; Gx)', in order to distinguish it from the two short-scope quantifiers of schema (ii) '(Ex)Fx &middot; (Ex)Gx'. For if it were an instance of (ii) as ordinarily interpreted by logicians--say by Quine (1961)--then the discovery that there was something x that was a man and something else x that came would satisfy the claim of (7) in a way that is plainly contrary to our intention. But we construe (7) in such a way that it does not require this embellishment; for recurring instances of any given non- designating variable in the same Loglan sentence are all taken to refer to the same indefinite someone or something. Thus <B>ba</B> implicitly recurs in (7), for (7) may be expanded into the connected sentence (7a) <B>Ba mrenu</B>, <B>ice ba pa kamla</B> (literally, 'x is a man; and x came') by means of the sentence connective <B>ice</B> which we have not come to yet (see <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.23">Section 5.23</A> on connected sentences); but the two instances of <B>ba</B> which occur in it may <EM>not</EM> be interpreted as referring to different objects. If we want to make the distinction in Loglan which is imputed to the difference between schemata (i) and (ii) in contemporary logic, we must use different variables: (7b) <B>Ba mrenu ice be pa kamla</B> (literally 'x is a man and <EM>y</EM> came'). The Loglan convention here is that while <B>ba</B> and <B>be</B> do not have to be distinct somethings, they may be. Again note that it is the more interesting of the two claims (7a) and (7b) that can be more briefly said in Loglan. We should also note that these arrangements necessitate some changes in the schematization of logical law as applied to Loglan; thus, for Loglan sentences, schemata (i) and (ii) are equivalent, and a third schema (iii) '(Ex)Fx &middot; (Ey)Gy' would have to be introduced to accommodate their former difference. As far as I know, the other adjustments are equally harmless; but the matter has not been studied exhaustively.</P>

<P><A NAME="note39">39</A> To see that the word 'man' in 'A man came' does make some kind of claim against the world--and is therefore not a designation--suppose that we found out, by exhaustive search, that only one thing came and that one thing was a woman. Would we not then regard our previous remark 'A man came' as false? This contrasts rather strikingly with the fate of '<EM>The</EM> man came' under the same circumstances; for in that case all we should care about would be whether the woman that came was in fact the person designated by the speaker whether camouflaged or not.</P>

<!-- .H4 ARGUMENTS -->
<P><A NAME="note40">40</A> The very least that we should require of a designation is that it function, even if temporarily, as a name: that is, that there be exactly one thing or set of things about which the speaker is saying whatever da is saying and of which some portion of da's speech functions as a verifiable label. 'John came' says the speaker. 'Is this John?' we ask, working our way down the list of Johns. Somewhere, sometime the speaker must say yes; for there must be at least a quasi-John which satisfies da's intentions. For if there is not, da is not playing the two-handed game we have here called "designation" according to its rules. Now names, descriptions, and the free, demonstrative and personal variables all satisfy this strict behavioral criterion. Words like 'someone', however, do not. If we make the mistake of thinking that they do and ask of someone who says 'Someone came', 'Is this someone?' we may be told yes or no indiscriminately with every presentation; for everyone we present <EM>is</EM> someone and no one we present will be the intended someone the speaker "has in mind." In short, the speaker has made a zero-order designation: a most peculiar and powerful maneuver which enables da to predicate something of the world without committing daself to locating anything in it. That so fastidious an act should lurk behind every "universal" claim is one of the most curious and far-reaching discoveries of modern logic.</P>

<P><A NAME="note41">41</A> This explains why 'someone' and 'something' are among the favorite words of children. 'Someone broke it' gives nothing away. Closely related is the strange intransitive sense of such verbs as '(to) break' in such sentences as 'It broke', which is a kind of suppressed passive: 'It was broken by someone or something (and I'm not saying who or what).'</P>

<P><A NAME="note42">42</A> Again we assume that the implicit quantifier has sentence-long scope, i.e., that sentence (11) is an instance of schema (i) (x)(Fx --&gt; Gx) and not of schema (ii) (x)Fx --&gt; (x)Gx, see Note 38 above. For the system of implicit quantification foreshadowed here, see <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.24">Section 5.24</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="note43">43</A> In 1975 Loglan the word <B>raba</B> was the phrase <B>ra ba</B>. In this it was like the phrase <B>le po</B>, one of whose senses also ascended to wordhood during this period while another retained the meaning of a distinct two-word phrase. I do not yet know what causes some phrases to become words while other, even very common phrases do not. One is haunted by the evident histories of such natural words as 'nevertheless' and 'understand'. By what process do these strings of once-separable elements consolidate and become, to speakers of that language, single items in the speechflow? I have no idea what is happening here. But with Loglan, we will probably have a chance to observe this event fairly frequently. It has already occurred more than once.</P>

<!-- .H4 NOTES -->
<P><A NAME="note44">44</A> The argument for preserving the logicality-alogicality option in Loglan is summarized in Note 28.</P>

<P><A NAME="note45">45</A> Such as <B>no</B>...<B>a</B>..., as in <B>Raba no mrenu, a mitro titci</B> ('Each something is a non-man or a meat-eater').</P>

<P><A NAME="note46">46</A> This is not an accident. Whenever a complete English predicate may be expressed with unmarked arguments, such as 'give' may be in '...gives... ...', we have adopted that order as the dictionary order of the places of the corresponding Loglan predicate. In these cases we have learned our lesson, as it were, about the behavior of unmarked arguments from this one natural language. The operative word, however, is 'complete'. Very few multiplace English predicates <EM>can</EM> be completely expressed without prepositions. So for these far more numerous cases, other considerations have been used to determine the dictionary order of the corresponding Loglan predicates; see Brown (1969b, Ch.9) reprinted in <CITE>TL1</CITE>:101-9.</P>

<P><A NAME="note47">47</A> Linguists will recognize in this tagging system a means of translating the sentences of <EM>any</EM> natural language into Loglan in unaltered order. By tagging them, the elements in the source sentence may be kept in their original order no matter what the order type of the source language is. For example, specimen (15) might translate a sentence from a VSO language ("Verb-Subject-Object"); specimen (13), a sentence from an SOV language; while specimen (10) is in fact a translation from our own SVO language. Loglan-normal word order is SVO as well, of course, because that order is the normal (unmarked) order in the languages spoken by 83% of Loglan's "source population", i.e., 83% of the speakers of the eight most populous languages of the world; see Brown (1969b), Ch.6, The Word-Order Problem, reprinted in <CITE>TL1</CITE>:54-61. Still, it is important to note that once again Loglan's pervasive optionality makes departure from these statistical norms quite easy. Loglan may be spoken in either of the other two standard word orders, VSO or SOV, if one chooses...in fact, in any of the three abnormal orders OVS, VOS and OSV (in which the object precedes the subject) as well. Again Loglan has made an important, and this time highly variable, feature of the natural languages plainly imitable; and it has done this without departing from our rule of keeping the weight of the disambiguation burden on the Loglan listener at precisely zero.</P>

<P><A NAME="note48">48</A> The Loglan case system was developed during the years 1984-87 and announced in Brown (1987). Developmental studies were performed during those years by a visiting Latinist, who wishes to remain anonymous, by my daughter, Jennifer Fuller Brown, and by myself. With optional cases we hope to be able to test Fillmore's (1968) theory on the naturalness of case, as well as to solve certain practical problems of everyday Loglan speech that have arisen since 1975...problems which in a small way tend to confirm Fillmore's theory. But obviously more systematic observations are required.</P>

MRH:  It should be noted that case tags representing the numerical position of arguments have been added to the toolkit:  <B>zua, zue, zui, zuo, zuu</B> for the occupant of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th argument place of the predicate.<p>

<P><A NAME="note49">49</A> We predict that this will be true in Loglan as well. This is because the negative clause of the <B>noa</B>-sentence will have gone past by the time the infixed <B>noa</B> (<B>no + a</B>) appears. So the listener must go back over the clause da has just heard as a positive one in order to re-understand it as negated. In <B>anoi</B>-sentences the clause to be negated still lies ahead when the <B>no</B>-bearing connective appears, so no back-parsing is required. This observation is due to John Parks-Clifford (personal communication).</P>

<P><A NAME="note50">50</A> I suspect that this is true in English as well. But as English usage alternates rather less decisively between what I am calling "marked" and "unmarked" connected forms, it is difficult to be sure what unmarked strings of English connectives mean.</P>

<P><A NAME="note51">51</A> The system of marked connectives described in this and earlier sections differs from the 1975 system in ways proposed by John Parks-Clifford in (1980:59-62).</P>

<P><A NAME="note52">52</A> It will probably be clear by this time that I am using the notion of sameness of claim in the logician's sense of having the same truth-values under all imaginable circumstances. Thus any given claim may be expressed in many ways; but however it is expressed, the truth-values of any pair of those ways will remain the same under any given set of circumstances, and this will be true of all of its expressions under all sets of circumstances. So construed, sameness of claim is obviously not the same as sameness of meaning; nor is it a condition that we yet know how to measure empirically. Unfortunately linguists have so far not developed behavioral criteria by which to assess either of these matters. So we are as yet confined to the analytic methods of philosophers if we are to talk about what a sentence claims at all. Most linguists, of course, choose the Draconian horn of this dilemma and banish the topic altogether. There is, however, no escaping the problem of what a sentence "claims" if we are to talk about what happens to meaning under the transformations generally called logical.</P>

<P><A NAME="note53">53</A> In fact they must be exported before any implicit quantifiers may be made explicit; see Sections 5.24 and 5.25 on quantified and negative sentences.</P>

<P><A NAME="note54">54</A> Sentences with non-designative arguments <EM>may</EM> be converted if and only if all such arguments are of the same type (all universal or all existential) and sign (all positive or all negative).</P>

<P><A NAME="note55">55</A> This is a special case of the "rule of reversal" given in <A HREF="chap5.html#sec5.25">Section 5.25</A>. By that rule, if a sentence contains no non-designating arguments, the signs of both the sentence and its predicate may be simultaneously reversed. Thus a positive sentence with a negative predicate may be transformed into a negative sentence with a positive predicate; and this is exportation.</P>

<P><A NAME="rnote1">R1</A> The personal pronouns were completely reorganized in the 1990's.  Originally there were fifteen pronouns organized in series <B>miV</B>, <B>muV</B>, <B>tuV</B>, with <B>tui</B> (for example) 
meaning <B>tu ze di</B>, and the rules of reference for the DA component applying to such compounds.  The original L1 text did not draw the distinction between "plural" pronouns with joint and independent senses.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote2">R2</A> I am conscious of having done violence to this section.  There have been changes in the Loglan letteral system since 1989.  The <B>-fi</B> series are now the lower-case Latin letters.  In constructing my parser, I abandoned the Greek capitals (though see below re the latter);  I originally omitted the Greek vowels but reinstated them recently.  The letters <B>q,w,x</B> have been evicted from the language.<p>

My parser generalizes the old Greek capital letter construction by allowing <B>gao</B> <EM>word</EM> to be a letteral for any phonetically permitted Loglan word.  Such letterals do not have quite unlimited privileges in my grammar at the moment, but they can be used.<p>

The construction of letters C-<B>aiu</B> and C-<B>-eiu</B> which yields the letterals for the non-Loglan Latin letters is general:  the parser will accept other letterals in this series.  I don't know what if any shapes they may eventually be agreed to have.<p>

I discourage the use of letters to abbreviate spoken Loglan just as I discourage the use of punctuation marks to do so.  The parser only accepts letterals properly spelled out.<p>

I deprecate the original Loglan vowel names, though I have supported their use.  They are seriously phonetically irregular in form.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote3">R3</A> In 1989 Loglan, a name word can be used by itself as a vocative.  This is now forbidden:  it causes disastrous instances of the "false name marker problem".  The other words which can be used as vocative markers are <B>loi, loa, sia, sie, siu</B>:  "hello", "good-bye", "Thank you", "Sorry", "You're welcome/Don't mention it"</B>, all little words of social lubrication which are natural accompaniers of a name used vocatively.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote4">R4</A> The text here had to be modified:  the original explains what is no longer true, that kekked head-modifiers, though not allowed in sentence predicates, are allowed in description predicates, and explains how they group...in a way they no longer group.  Instead, we give examples of how metaphors with kekked components work, with attention to how a kekked component (whether head or not) is to be terminated where desired, which is the same in both sentence and description predicates.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote5">R5</A> We note that <B>je</B> and <B>jue</B> in fact have nothing in particular to do with description!  They are quite general devices for binding arguments very tightly to predicates, whose most obvious use is in descriptions, but this is far from their only potential use.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote6">R6</A> The replacement of the original <B>mo</B> for 000 with <B>moa</B> was driven by
overuse of this syllable.  Repetition of <B>moa</B> is more burdensome than repetition of <B>mo</B>, which suggested lightening the burden of repetition.  You will find in the PEG that quantifiers (class NI) have more internal grammar than in 1989 Loglan, partly for this reason and partly because of further attention to SA prefixes.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote7">R7</A> Actually, one <EM>can</EM>.  <B>Ra ge te me le mrenu</B>, all of three of the men.  But one has to work at it.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote8">R8</A> A RA immediately following a SA prefix will not be read as forming a numerical predicate:  thus <B>sunera</B> is the numerical predicate used here; <B>sura</B> is a quantifier word.  This is a reform in the 2013 implementation, which gives the SA prefixes more "grammar".<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote9">R9</A> Acronyms used as dimensions must start with the marker <B>mue</B> and one must pause after them, as part of the reform of phonetic problems with acronyms.  I do not impose the stress requirement on numerical descriptions that JCB does (though I have the machinery to do it and might consider it);  note that a simple <B>gu</B> will neatly terminate a numerical description.  I do allow pauses internally to such descriptions, though not in the same places that JCB does in his examples.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote10">R10</A> Here I had a longstanding disagreement with our Founder, and I have rewritten the examples to express my view.  In fact, <B>me</B> has a very precise meaning, and can be used to express vague nuances of meaning nonetheless.  If X is an argument, <B>me</B> X means exactly "is one of the things designated by X".  It is crucially important to have this construction with this very precise meaning.  <B>Ta memi</B> means literally "That is I, myself", not "That is 'me'" in the scare quote sense, and it <B>must</B> mean that.  But, given that <B>me</B> has this exact meaning used as a base predicate, it acquires exactly the meaning JCB wants it to have when it is used as a predicate modifier.  A by-product of this discussion was the introduction of <B>mea</B> with JCB's less precise meaning for <B>me</B> and the same grammar:  I have always felt that this word is entirely redundant, and that all the work, both precise and vague, can be done by <B>me</B> alone.<p>

<P><A NAME="rnote11">R11</A> Strictly speaking, pausing after initial <B>no</B> does not always give it sentence-long scope.  It does in some contexts (the only remaining vestige of pause/<B>gu</B> equivalence).  But the logical sense is nonetheless preserved:  otherwise the <B>no</B> will usually negate the first argument, which has the same logical effect, and the pause is sufficient to prevent the <B>no</B> from being absorbed into the sentence in other ways which would mess up its sense.<p>
