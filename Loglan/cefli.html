 <h1>Vi le Sritoe pe la Cefli</h1>

<h2>that is, on the desk of the CEO of the Loglan Institute</h2> </center>

Welcome to the doubtless somewhat untidy web presence of Randall Holmes, 
 qua "chief executive officer" of the Loglan Institute (the title seems excessively grand, but that is what it is, officially). 
 I prefer <b>la Cefli</b>, in Loglan :-)  This version of the page is being prepared in June 2020 as part of porting my
 personal web page out of the purview of my employer.  The original version is still to be found on my old web page.

<p>

The Loglan Institute (TLI) is the official organization which coordinates 
 the development of the artifical human language Loglan.   The main Loglan web site is <a href="http://www.loglan.org/">here</a>:  that is the place to look for lots of general information and resources on the language.  There is a mirror of this site (not always perfect) <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/loglan.org/welcome.html">here</a> at Boise State.

Here is a good place to start finding out what Loglan is, <a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan1/index.html">Loglan
I (fourth edition)</a> by James Cooke Brown.</p>

Here is a <A HREF = "Loglan1/index.html">

<A HREF="Reports/reference_grammar_proposed.pdf">Here</A> 
 is a brand-new (May 1 2018) <B>proposed reference grammar for the language</B>.  
 This supersedes the grammar sections of the Spring 2018 report just below

 and relationships to earlier versions of the grammar not found in the reference grammar. UPDATED 1/23/2022.

<center><h3>Parser</h3></center>

I have developed and am constantly upgrading a parser for Loglan, which has involved investigating and sometimes proposing modifications to 
all sorts of features of the language.  The problem with the original state of things was that
LIP (the old parser) was based on a now publicly available formal grammar which was provably unambiguous (as per our aims) <b>on the level of grammar</b>, but which was much more opaque (and demonstrably has errors) in the area of parsing individual words.  It is legacy software, and I have no way to maintain it conveniently, and further it is now outdated.  So I have written and am maintaining my own parser.

<p>

The parser uses PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars), a
scheme for developing parsers (developed by Bryan Ford) described
<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/parsing:popl04.pdf">here</a>.   This differs from a use of a BNF grammar disambiguated using yacc which underlies LIP, and does raise questions about ambiguity (or more correctly, unintended parse) problems.

</p><p>  

The parser has versions written in two different languages, Standard ML and Python.  
    The time leak that I was experiencing with the Python version seems to have been fixed:  it runs acceptably fast.
    Only the Python version is being reliably maintained as of Spring 2018: 
    I finally ported some development tools that I had only in the ML version to Python (with improvements!)
    so the Python version is now the flagship.

</p><p>

<b>The ML version:</b>  <B>The ML version is now outdated and not being actively maintained for the moment.</B> 
    <a href="Sources/pegparser.sml">Here</a>
find the PEG parser generator (written by me, updated 1/8/2017 with a change to logging to support batch processing) which I
use to generate the provisional PEG parser for Loglan (written by me, updated constantly, get a new version often)
implemented <a href="Sources/loglangrammar.sml">here</a>
(this is now the test parser initiated on 9/4/2016, latest update 1/8/2017, adds batch processing functions). 
    Both of these are files to be run
using the <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html">Moscow ML
interpreter</a>, which is free and runs on many platforms. The files
are each documented at their front ends. I also have versions for Moscow ML 2.10.1 and for Poly/ML, available on request.</p>

<b>The Python version:</b>  Here is a Python module for parsing Loglan, 
    <a href="Sources/loglan.py">loglan.py</a>;  <a href="Sources/loglan-alternative .py">loglan-alternative.py</a> is the version making essential use of gaa.
(always the latest version, update regularly), 
    which calls a utility module <a href="Sources/loglanpreamble.py">loglanpreamble.py</a>
 which calls a PEG parsing Python
module <a href="Sources/peg.py">peg.py</a> (get the updated version of both the latter two files now and then).  
    Please notice that from 2/10/2016 on you need <B>THREE</B> Python files here.<p>
    You can if you prefer use the single file <a href="Sources/omnibus.py">omnibus.py</a> (which I really create to provide the Trinket app online).<p>
    
 You can parse Loglan utterances using
my grammar in this environment. All functions are working pretty well now, but of course there may be bugs.
    Please tell me about any problems that you find!  

<p>
<a href="Sources/draft-grammar-with-comments.peg">Here</a>
is the Loglan PEG source in Ford's exact syntax in a text format
generated by the Python parser engine. I do try to keep this up to date. 
 This might be useful if someone wants to try this with different PEG software.</p>
 
 The Python grammar files have been updated 1/19/2022;  I have switched back to turning off the ``alternative parser" features using gaa for the time being.<p>



<center><h3>  Sample texts </h3></center>

I set up the teaching corpus in Notebook 3 as input to the parser.

<p>

Here
is a file <a href="Sources/corpus-original.llg">corpus-alternative.llg</a>
of parsed Loglan sentences (if you have the file 
 <a href="Sources/corpus-original.txt">corpus-alternative.txt</a>,
 this file is generated by typing &gtcorpus in the parser interface), this now contains the entire teaching corpus in NB3
modified to work with the current grammar.
 </p><p>
 
<b>More sample material (these are also Python files to be run in the presence of the Python parser files):</b>  
    <a href="Sources/loglan1.py">Lots
of parsed examples from Loglan 1</a> ;  <a href ="Sources/predicatetest.py">Some
examples of complex predicates and phonetic parses</a><B>these need updates</B></p>

<p>

<a href="Texts/towerclock.txt">Here</a> and <a href="Texts/thechase.txt">here</a>  
 find translations of my friend Laura's poems.<p>

<a href="Texts/beowulf2.txt">Here</a> is a translation of a small opening segment of the Old English poem Beowulf, with parses
    <a href="Texts/beowulf2.llg">here</a> and a version that doesn't parse but does have notes <a href="Texts/Beowulf.txt">here</a>.
    I have started adding to it again in January 2016!<p>

I am parsing the text of the Visit to Loglandia, the novel by Alex Leith which is the largest single Loglan text.
    It may be useful to note that my input files include comments on the revisions I had to make in the text 
    to make it parse.<p>

The particular points that often need repair in this text are worth noting<p>
<UL>
<LI> My parser religiously requires commas after Loglan names.  Serial names often need to 
be reformatted a little.  Syllabic consonants have to be doubled.  
 Names with non-Loglan letters in them become foreign names marked with
<B>lao</B>.

<LI> strong quotation is different (and does not come out badly in this text).

<LI> APA and IPA words are a pain.  In particular, the need to mark APA and IPA words with explicit pauses 
 is a frequent source of slight changes from Leith's text.  But he also really uses APA and IPA words.  
 Leith does seem to be aware of the issue (as I think JCB was).

<LI> inverse vocatives made from arguments often need to be closed with <B>guu</B> to avoid eating following sentences.
 The sentence form is heavily used -- it is clear what it is for.  But the use with arguments needs to be guarded 
 (a grammar change was necessary to fix this, and it reflected a genuine ambiguity in 1989 Loglan,  
 not detected because of the role of preparsing).  Actually, inverse vocatives made from sentences also need 
 to be closed with guu frequently to keep from consuming unintended further arguments.

<LI>  One needs to watch out for closures with <B>guo</B> and its kin.  
 My parser does not have pause/GU equivalence.  I do not think Leith relies heavily on it, 
 but he does not always effect the closures he needs.

<LI> I believe that Leith himself was responsible for a number of badly formed predicates in his text,
 which I have fixed.  He inspired me to scan the dictionary.

<LI>  all installments have been scanned with the latest version of the parser.

<LI>  I have also parsed most of the other texts on the Loglan page, and will post links to these when I take the time to sit down and set up the links.

<center><h2> La Keugru:  the Loglan Academy</h2></center>

The Loglan Academy is a small group which makes official decisions about updates to the formal definition of the language.

<p>

<a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan1/app-h.html">Here</a> is a pointer to Appendix H of Loglan I, 
 which details the past work of the Academy.

The Academy is currently unreponsive, so I am promulgating provisional versions of the language which I hope will eventually be accepted
 by consensus of those few who are interested!
 
<p>

It is important to note that my PEG grammar includes features which are still under consideration by the Academy. 
 However, it should parse most Loglan sentences a learner will produce correctly, and indeed LIP will still do this in 
 most cases.


</p><center><h2>  Institutional and historical information </h2></center>


The Loglan project was founded by James Cooke Brown (JCB) in about 1955:  it was originally intended as a tool to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.   To test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in the laboratory, he needed a language which was manageably small, but nonetheless a human language, and which was extreme in some respect, so that it might be expected to have Whorfian effects.   He chose to make the language extremely logical; he also chose to make it syntactically unambiguous.  The aim was that the structure of a Loglan sentence can always be determined precisely, and indeed that Loglan can be parsed by a computer.

<p> 

At Brown's death in 2000, Robert A McIvor was CEO of the Institute; in 2008 when McIvor retired from this role he appointed me.  I am not a member of the original group that built the language, though I had some personal contact with JCB and served as the logical consultant (la Lodtua) for a while in the 1990's; I am always interested to learn more about the earlier history of the project from those who were there.  The Academy which made official decisions about the development of the language had made its last ruling in 1996 and was essentially defunct until I reconstituted it in 2013.

</p><p>

There is a sister language, Lojban, whose main web site is <a href="http://www.lojban.org/">here</a>, Ido to our Esperanto.   The schism between the two languages happened about 1987 and culminated, alas, in a lawsuit, hinging on the fact that JCB claimed copyright on the word "Loglan" and on the Loglan vocabulary.  He lost the point about the word, and the other language as a result has (or had originally) quite similar grammar and semantics and an unintelligible vocabulary (though even the vocabulary is formally similar in important ways).   The two languages have drifted apart since, but are still quite closely related.  Lojban has a much larger community and more activity.  I think the original
language still has something to offer, and the existence of two
languages may provide some opportunities as well.   Whatever the situation in the past, TLI is on good terms with the LLG which steers the development of Lojban, and though we do claim that essential materials of Loglan are the intellectual property of TLI and/or of their individual authors, we make them freely available to anyone with a private interest in learning the language or experimenting with modifications of the language (including Lojbanists!).  Before undertaking any other use of the materials (and certainly before making any claim that your favorite modification is a feature of TLI Loglan!), please talk to us.
