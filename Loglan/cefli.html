 <h1>Vi le Sritoe pe la Cefli</h1>

<h2>that is, on the desk of the CEO of the Loglan Institute</h2> </center>

Welcome to the doubtless somewhat untidy web presence of Randall Holmes, 
 qua "chief executive officer" of the Loglan Institute (the title seems excessively grand, but that is what it is, officially). 
 I prefer <b>la Cefli</b>, in Loglan :-)  I am tidying up this page on Jan 30, 2022.<p>

<p>

The Loglan Institute (TLI) is the official organization which coordinates 
 the development of the artifical human language Loglan.   The main Loglan web site is <a href="http://www.loglan.org/">here</a>:  that is the place to look for lots of general information and resources on the language.
</p><p>

Here is a good place to start finding out what Loglan is, <a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan1/index.html">Loglan
I (fourth edition)</a> by James Cooke Brown.</p>

Here is a <A HREF = "Loglan1/index.html">
 a revision of Loglan 1 in progress</A>; I have completed a first editing pass. 
 It includes a recent HTML version of the PEG with comments as an appendix, perhaps intended to have cross-links to the text.<p>

<p>

<A HREF="Reports/reference_grammar_proposed.pdf">This</A> 
 is the <B>proposed reference grammar for the language</B>.  Originally, I intended to submit this as a series of proposals to an advisory Keugru (a version of the old Loglan Academy of the same name) but that group has not been active.  So it is a body of proposals to the community, backed up by the fact that the parser implements the syntactical parts of these proposals (mod bugs).  Discussion is very welcome;  I would love it if people would test this document by reading it.  Updated 1/30/2022<p>
 
 Parser resourses (all updated 2/15/2022):<p>
 <UL>
 
 <LI>  The PEG engine:  <A HREF = "Sources/peg.py">here</a>  and Loglan preliminary file <A HREF = "Sources/loglanpreamble.py">here</a>.<p>
 
 <LI>  The current official parser <A HREF = "Sources/loglan.py">here</a>.  This needs the two files under the first heading.  The current official parser <A HREF = "Sources/omnibus.py">here</a>, in a one-file format incorporating the PEG engine and preamble.<p>
 
 <LI>  A test parser permitting multiple arguments before the predicate in a simple sentence:  <A HREF = "Sources/loglantest.py">here</a>.  This requires the two files under the first heading.  The test parser <A HREF = "Sources/omnibustest.py">here</a>, in a one-file format incorporating the PEG engine and preamble.<p>
 
 <LI>  The PEG grammar for the official parser in a compact form <A HREF = "Sources/loglancompact.peg">here</a>.  In its fully commented form
 <A HREF = "Sources/draft-grammar-with-comments.peg">here</a>.<p>
 
 This was updated 2/15/2022 with systematic changes to rule names in the grammar.<p>
 
 Just for clarity and lack of clutter, we now provide only one official grammar file, which is for the official parser.  The test parser is obtained by not requiring the use
 of GIO in the grammar rule <TT>statement</TT>:  put a question mark after it.  Our opinion is that it should be required;  flexibility about its use is nice for poetry.<p>
 
 For those with special PEG file needs, <A HREF = "Sources/loglancompacttest.peg">here</a> is a compact PEG without comments for the test parser.<p>

There is a mailing list for people interested in Loglan.  
 The original one, <TT>loglanists@ucsd.edu</TT> is dead (and alas, we do not have archives for it:  people who have local archives of this list are encouraged to share them;  I have records since about 2008).  The new one is <TT>loglanists@googlegroups.com</TT>.  Email me, Randall Holmes, to get info about it.<p>
 
 There is a Discord server devoted to Loglan:  <A HREF="https://discord.gg/VUHdePJJNu">this</a> is an invitation to it.<p>
 
 A small group meets every week at 9 am Pacific time in the online world Second Life to talk (well, mostly write) in and about Loglan.  You can ask me about it if interested.<p>

<center><h3>Parser</h3></center>

I have developed and am constantly upgrading a parser for Loglan, which has involved investigating and sometimes proposing modifications to 
all sorts of features of the language.  The problem with the original state of things was that
LIP (the old parser) was based on a now publicly available formal grammar which was provably unambiguous (as per our aims) <b>on the level of grammar</b>, but which was much more opaque (and demonstrably has errors) in the area of parsing individual words.  It is legacy software, and I have no way to maintain it conveniently, and further it is now outdated.  So I have written and am maintaining my own parser.

<p>

The parser uses PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars), a
scheme for developing parsers (developed by Bryan Ford) described
<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/parsing:popl04.pdf">here</a>.   This differs from a use of a BNF grammar disambiguated using yacc which underlies LIP, and does raise questions about ambiguity (or more correctly, unintended parse) problems.<p>

The Python programs which call the parser to parse Loglan text and the PEG grammar of the official parser and a test parser are provided at the top of the page.<p>



<center><h3>  Sample texts </h3></center>

I set up the teaching corpus in Notebook 3 as input to the parser.  This has had to be edited repeatedly as the language has changed quite a bit since Notebook 3.

<p>

Here
is a file <a href="Sources/corpus-original.llg">corpus-original.llg</a>
of parsed Loglan sentences (if you have the file 
 <a href="Sources/corpus-original.txt">corpus-original.txt</a>,
 this file is generated by typing &gtcorpus-original in the parser interface), this now contains the entire teaching corpus in NB3
modified to work with the current grammar.  This is up to date;  it's the first test suite for each parser update.<p>
 </p><p>
 
<b>More sample material (these are also Python files to be run in the presence of the Python parser files):</b>  <p>
    <a href="Sources/loglan1.py">Lots
of parsed examples from Loglan 1</a> ;  <p><a href ="Sources/predicatetest.py">Some
examples of complex predicates and phonetic parses</a><p><B>these need updates (they have not been run with a recent version of the parser)</B></p>

<p>

<a href="Texts/towerclock.txt">Here</a> and <a href="Texts/thechase.txt">here</a>  
 find translations of my friend Laura's poems.<p>

<a href="Texts/beowulf2.txt">Here</a> is a translation of a small opening segment of the Old English poem Beowulf, with parses
    <a href="Texts/beowulf2.llg">here</a> and a version that doesn't parse but does have notes <a href="Texts/Beowulf.txt">here</a>.<p>

I am parsing the text of the Visit to Loglandia, the novel by Alex Leith which is the largest single Loglan text <B>again</B>
    It may be useful to note that my input files include comments on the revisions I had to make in the text 
    to make it parse.<p>

The particular points that often need repair in this text are worth noting<p>
<UL>
<LI> My parser religiously requires commas after Loglan names.  Serial names often need to 
be reformatted a little.  Syllabic consonants have to be doubled.  
 Names with non-Loglan letters in them become foreign names marked with
<B>lao</B>.

<LI> strong quotation is different (and does not come out badly in this text).

<LI> APA and IPA words are a pain.  In particular, the need to mark APA and IPA words with explicit pauses 
 is a frequent source of slight changes from Leith's text.  But he also really uses APA and IPA words.  
 Leith does seem to be aware of the issue (as I think JCB was).

<LI> inverse vocatives made from arguments often need to be closed with <B>guu</B> to avoid eating following sentences.
 The sentence form is heavily used -- it is clear what it is for.  But the use with arguments needs to be guarded 
 (a grammar change was necessary to fix this, and it reflected a genuine ambiguity in 1989 Loglan,  
 not detected because of the role of preparsing).  Actually, inverse vocatives made from sentences also need 
 to be closed with giuo frequently to keep from consuming unintended further arguments.

<LI>  One needs to watch out for closures with <B>guo</B> and its kin.  
 My parser does not have pause/GU equivalence.  I do not think Leith relies heavily on it, 
 but he does not always effect the closures he needs.

<LI> I believe that Leith himself was responsible for a number of badly formed predicates in his text,
 which I have fixed.  He inspired me to scan the dictionary.

<LI>  all installments have been scanned with the latest version of the parser.

<LI>  Currently I am providing links to the new parsing of the Visit, which is underway, so not all of the text is covered.  I decided to re-parse it because the first time I was testing the parser and revising it as I went, and at each subsequent change in the parser I made further revisions, and the total is rather a hodgepodge.  In the new version I am preserving the original text more carefully, parsing each paragraph with the same now fairly stable parser (the official version which requires [gio]) and commenting on notable changes found in each paragraph.

<LI><A HREF  ="Texts/loglandia/loglandia1-phonetic.txt">Here</a> is the text of the first installment in the format I fed

Eventually I will parse the entire file and present one monster file with parses, but for now I am posting the chapter by chapter parses I have posted on the Discord server.<p>
 
 In the latest pass, I have made additional grammar corrections in the individual files below which are not reflected in the running text above (they are guided by looking at the parses).  At the end of the process I will assemble a single corrected Visit text and make a single monstrously large parse file.<p>

<center><h2> La Keugru:  the Loglan Academy</h2></center>

The Loglan Academy is (or was) a small group which makes official decisions about updates to the formal definition of the language.

<p>

<a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan1/app-h.html">Here</a> is a pointer to Appendix H of Loglan I, 
 which details the past work of the Academy.

I don't really believe that there is currently an Academy, so I am promulgating provisional versions of the language which I hope will eventually be accepted
 by consensus of the interested community!
 
<p>



</p><center><h2>  Institutional and historical information </h2></center>


The Loglan project was founded by James Cooke Brown (JCB) in about 1955:  it was originally intended as a tool to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.   To test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in the laboratory, he needed a language which was manageably small, but nonetheless a human language, and which was extreme in some respect, so that it might be expected to have Whorfian effects.   He chose to make the language extremely logical; he also chose to make it syntactically unambiguous.  The aim was that the structure of a Loglan sentence can always be determined precisely, and indeed that Loglan can be parsed by a computer.

<p> 

At Brown's death in 2000, Robert A McIvor was CEO of the Institute; in 2008 when McIvor retired from this role he appointed me.  I am not a member of the original group that built the language, though I had some personal contact with JCB and served as the logical consultant (la Lodtua) for a while in the 1990's; I am always interested to learn more about the earlier history of the project from those who were there.  The Academy which made official decisions about the development of the language had made its last ruling in 1996 and was essentially defunct until I reconstituted it in 2013.

</p><p>

There is a sister language, Lojban, whose main web site is <a href="http://www.lojban.org/">here</a>, Ido to our Esperanto.   The schism between the two languages happened about 1987 and culminated, alas, in a lawsuit, hinging on the fact that JCB claimed copyright on the word "Loglan" and on the Loglan vocabulary.  He lost the point about the word, and the other language as a result has (or had originally) quite similar grammar and semantics and an unintelligible vocabulary (though even the vocabulary is formally similar in important ways).   The two languages have drifted apart since, but are still quite closely related.  Lojban has a much larger community and more activity.  I think the original
language still has something to offer, and the existence of two
languages may provide some opportunities as well.   Whatever the situation in the past, TLI is on good terms with the LLG which steers the development of Lojban, and though we do claim that essential materials of Loglan are the intellectual property of TLI and/or of their individual authors, we make them freely available to anyone with a private interest in learning the language or experimenting with modifications of the language (including Lojbanists!).  Before undertaking any other use of the materials (and certainly before making any claim that your favorite modification is a feature of TLI Loglan!), please talk to us.
