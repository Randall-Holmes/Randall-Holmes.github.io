 <h1>Vi le Sritoe pe la Cefli</h1>

<h2>that is, on the desk of the CEO of the Loglan Institute</h2> </center>

Welcome to the doubtless somewhat untidy web presence of Randall Holmes, 
 qua "chief executive officer" of the Loglan Institute (the title seems excessively grand, but that is what it is, officially). 
 I prefer <b>la Cefli</b>, in Loglan :-)  I am tidying up this page on 10/19/2024.  My email is <TT>m.randall.holmes@gmail.com</TT><p>

<p>

The Loglan Institute (TLI) is the official organization which coordinates 
 the development of the artifical human language Loglan.   The official Loglan web site is <a href="http://www.loglan.org/">here</a>:  that is the place to look for lots of general information and resources on the language.  This web site is probably more to the point for recent developments in the language, but there is a great deal of value on the official site, and we thank James Jennings for keeping it going.<p>
</p><p>

<H2>Basic resources</H2>

Here is a good place to start finding out what Loglan is, <a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan1/index.html">Loglan
I (fourth edition)</a> by James Cooke Brown.</p>

Here is a <A HREF = "Loglan1/index.html">
 a revision of Loglan 1 in progress</A>; I have completed a first editing pass. 
 It includes a  version of the PEG (I am not sure how recent) with comments as an appendix, perhaps intended to have cross-links to the text.  This version of Loglan 1 corrects the text to work correctly with the current grammar and parser.  It contains additional notes by Holmes explaining the reasons for changes.<p>


Here is <A HREF = "easy-loglan-introduction.html"> Alex Leith's Easy Loglan proposal</A> with some minor changes and comments by me.
<p>
<H4>The reference grammar</H4>
<A HREF="Reports/reference_grammar_proposed.pdf">This</A> 
 is the <B>proposed reference grammar for the language</B>.  Originally, I intended to submit this as a series of proposals to an advisory Keugru (a version of the old Loglan Academy of the same name) but that group has not been active.  So it is a body of proposals to the community, backed up by the fact that the parser implements the syntactical parts of these proposals (mod bugs).  Discussion is very welcome;  I would love it if people would test this document by reading it.<p>
 
 <H4>Parser resources</H4>
 <UL>
 
 <LI>  The current official parser <A HREF = "Sources/omnibus.py">here</a>, in a one-file format incorporating the PEG engine and preamble.<p>

 <LI>  The PEG grammar for the official parser in a compact form <A HREF = "Sources/loglancompact.peg">here</a>.  In its fully commented form
 <A HREF = "Sources/draft-grammar-with-comments.peg">here</a>.<p>
 
 A test parser which allowed multiple arguments before the predicate was posted here earlier.  We may presently reinstate it (or allow it to supersede the present version) after some projected editing of the grammar and some tests of this concept with the text of the novella, A Visit to Loglandia.<p>
 
 For those with special PEG file needs, <A HREF = "Sources/loglancompacttest.peg">here</a> is a compact PEG without comments for the test parser.<p>

The commentary notes some mistakes and some anachronisms; as long as those are kept in mind, I strongly recommend studying this text.  I have a version of Loglan 3 which I am able to edit:  I may presently post a revised version.<p>

    this has been steadily updated since Fall 2015) which is intended  
    be essentially a complete report on the state of the language from 
    my perspective as of Spring 2018.   It includes a list of issues that I have worked on, 
    an updated text of the reference grammar, a list of current proposals (including new ones), 
    the complete PEG grammar (I am still updating annotations to it), and the trial.85 grammar.

<center><h3>Parser</h3></center>

I have developed and am constantly upgrading a parser for Loglan, which has involved investigating and sometimes proposing modifications to 
all sorts of features of the language.  The problem with the original state of things was that
LIP (the old parser) was based on a now publicly available formal grammar which was provably unambiguous (as per our aims) <b>on the level of grammar</b>, but which was much more opaque (and demonstrably has errors) in the area of parsing individual words.  It is legacy software, and I have no way to maintain it conveniently, and further it is now outdated.  So I have written and am maintaining my own parser.

<p>

The parser uses PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars), a
scheme for developing parsers (developed by Bryan Ford) described
<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/parsing:popl04.pdf">here</a>.   This differs from a use of a BNF grammar disambiguated using yacc which underlies LIP, and does raise questions about ambiguity (or more correctly, unintended parse) problems.<p>

The Python programs which call the parser to parse Loglan text and the PEG grammar of the official parser and a test parser are provided at the top of the page.<p>

<center><h2>  Sample texts </h2></center>

I set up the teaching corpus in Notebook 3 as input to the parser.  This has had to be edited repeatedly as the language has changed quite a bit since Notebook 3. Here
is the file <a href="Sources/corpus-original.llg">corpus-original.llg</a>
of parsed Loglan sentences (if you have the file 
 <a href="Sources/corpus-original.txt">corpus-original.txt</a>,
 this file is generated by typing &gtcorpus-original in the parser interface), this now contains the entire teaching corpus in NB3
modified to work with the current grammar.  This is up to date;  it's the first test suite for each parser update.<p>

<center><h2> La Keugru:  the Loglan Academy</h2></center>

The Loglan Academy was a small group which made official decisions about updates to the formal definition of the language.  It is now inactive, and I am making proposals myself...which does not preclude proposals by other Loglanists, or an effort to revive an Academy.

<p>

<a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan1/app-h.html">Here</a> is a pointer to Appendix H of Loglan I, 
 which details the past work of the Academy.


 
<p>



</p><center><h2>  Institutional and historical information </h2></center>


The Loglan project was founded by James Cooke Brown (JCB) in about 1955:  it was originally intended as a tool to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.   To test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in the laboratory, he needed a language which was manageably small, but nonetheless a human language, and which was extreme in some respect, so that it might be expected to have Whorfian effects.   He chose to make the language extremely logical; he also chose to make it syntactically unambiguous.  The aim was that the structure of a Loglan sentence can always be determined precisely, and indeed that Loglan can be parsed by a computer.

<p> 

At Brown's death in 2000, Robert A McIvor was CEO of the Institute; in 2008 when McIvor retired from this role he appointed me.  I am not a member of the original group that built the language, though I had some personal contact with JCB and served as the logical consultant (la Lodtua) for a while in the 1990's; I am always interested to learn more about the earlier history of the project from those who were there.  The Academy which made official decisions about the development of the language had made its last ruling in 1996 and was essentially defunct until I reconstituted it in 2013.

</p><p>

There is a sister language, Lojban, whose main web site is <a href="http://www.lojban.org/">here</a>, Ido to our Esperanto.   The schism between the two languages happened about 1987 and culminated, alas, in a lawsuit, hinging on the fact that JCB claimed copyright on the word "Loglan" and on the Loglan vocabulary.  He lost the point about the word, and the other language as a result has (or had originally) quite similar grammar and semantics and an unintelligible vocabulary (though even the vocabulary is formally similar in important ways).   The two languages have drifted apart since, but are still quite closely related.  Lojban has a much larger community and more activity.  I think the original
language still has something to offer, and the existence of two
languages may provide some opportunities as well.   Whatever the situation in the past, TLI is on good terms with the LLG which steers the development of Lojban, and though we do claim that essential materials of Loglan are the intellectual property of TLI and/or of their individual authors, we make them freely available to anyone with a private interest in learning the language or experimenting with modifications of the language (including Lojbanists!).  Before undertaking any other use of the materials (and certainly before making any claim that your favorite modification is a feature of TLI Loglan!), please talk to us.
