<H3>Particular points to be noted in understanding my revisions of the Visit</H3>
<UL>
<LI> My parser religiously requires commas after Loglan names.  Serial names often need to 
be reformatted a little.  Syllabic consonants have to be doubled.  
 Names with non-Loglan letters in them become foreign names marked with
<B>lao</B>.

<LI> strong quotation is different (and does not come out badly in this text).

<LI> APA and IPA words are a pain.  In particular, the need to mark APA and IPA words with explicit pauses (and to require pauses where a break spoils an APA or IPA word to be comma marked) 
 is a frequent source of slight changes from Leith's text.  He really uses APA and IPA words quite often.  
 Leith does seem to be aware of the issue (as I think JCB was).<p>

<LI> inverse vocatives made from arguments often need to be closed with <B>guu</B> to avoid eating following sentences.
 The sentence form is heavily used -- it is clear what it is for.  But the use with arguments needs to be guarded 
 (a grammar change was necessary to fix this, and it reflected a genuine ambiguity in 1989 Loglan,  
 not detected because of the role of preparsing).  Actually, inverse vocatives made from sentences also need 
 to be closed with giuo frequently to keep from consuming unintended further arguments.
 
 <LI> Please note that this version was parsed with the official parser, which requires use of [gio] in SOV sentences.  For this to parse correctly in the test parser for which [gio] is optional, one would need to close more inverse vocatives with argument text with [guu] to avoid their being misread as inverse vocatives with weird SOV sentence test.  It is worth noting that Leith NEVER wrote an SOV sentence in the entire Visit:  I did not add [gio] anywhere.<p>


<LI>  One needs to watch out for closures with <B>guo</B> and its kin.  
 My parser does not have pause/GU equivalence.  I do not think Leith relies heavily on it, 
 but he does not always effect the closures he needs.  I was able to use information from my parses to detect a lot of failures to close lepo phrases properly, though surely not all of them (failures to close often created unintended gasents and imperatives).<p>

<LI> I believe that Leith himself was responsible for a number of badly formed predicates in his text,
 which I have fixed.  He inspired me to scan the dictionary.

<LI>  all installments have been scanned with the latest version of the parser.
