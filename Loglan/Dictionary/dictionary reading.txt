added koo and bao 4/16/2025 

Evie things 4/17/2025

should add mekca (makeup), the gvvV connectives

la Cuaits instead of lao Cvaitz

remove Linnaeans globally -- words in lao are not part of the language as a rule

missing words etc:

3.2
----

<bii> "is equal to (true indentity)" ... <bi> is given as "(is defined as)" here but "be identical to" in the dictionary

<dua> and <dui> are swapped, dictionary says <dua> is first and <dui> is second. same for <tio> <tao> etc later
these are to be analogous to ti and ta (by vowel)

3.3
----

idk if you want <ciha> in the dictionary or not  ADD IT

<tua> isn't in the dictionary, though if it's obsolete this makes sense

<koo>  DEALT WITH here

<kue> says it was removed in 2022 but is still *in* the dictionary  IT WILL APPEAR WITH A DIFFERENT DEF

the ecample for <ho> in the dictionary uses <hu>  CHECK

<bao>. this seems to be like both lojban {ce'u} and {ma kau}, interesting  DEALT WITH

<fea>, <kui>, <rui>  Not for the moment adding these.  They are in the grammar due to a theoretical discussion in the 1990's

<fau>, <vau>

<fi> to close connectives  ITS AN AFFIX NOT A WORD do we have affixes?

<loo>

<guoa gio guea guua giuo meu>

<kue> for eliminating slots  THIS NEEDS TO GO IN

<poiV puiV zoiV>  

3.4
----

"The legacy vowel letterals may not be used as djifoa, but the new ones are eligible: ziaytrena, “A-train”."
-zia/-zie/-zio are affixes for language/territory/culture; we could mandate that djifoa of lengu/landi/kultu or similar  are used instead to make this work.
how would this work for consonants?   I DONT SEE A CONFLICT, the affixes are in final position, the letters are initial position, but I should say something about it


Forgot <ciha>, leaving reminder for self

added <due>(see discussion in transcripts)

and <murse>, twilight, from Lojban



7/12/2025  things to go in

rarfao: V is the end of the world/universe B
pakviacue: K prophesies B to D
paknurvia: B is a (future) vision to D in context F
jarco: K shows B to D
paksaa: V is a sign of future event B
fomcea: K changes form to N (property)

These are due to la Bekli, but revised fut- to pak- systematically, and this probably merits an essay

add <licne>, clitoris, a typical body part predicate  (etymology is from Lojban?)


GRAMMMAR IDEA allow go X adverbial modifiers to be linked with A connectives

dukse, synonym for tsubae from Lojban


calni one place predicate, is a human child   new composite designed by la Bekli


look up the word for deja vu, it probably needs to be corrected
