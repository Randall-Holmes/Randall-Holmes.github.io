\item[Service Activities:]

\begin{description}

\item[]

\item[Professional:]  I referee papers for journals regularly (I estimate typically three or four referee reports to journals per year).  I am a reviewer for Mathematical Reviews.  I have served as an external reviewer for a number of tenure and promotion applications at other institutions, and I have been an external examiner for three Ph.D. candidates at other institutions.  I maintain web resources, including an extensive online bibliography, for the community of researchers on New Foundations.

\item[Community:]  I was invited to give a talk to a seminar for math and physics undergraduates at the College of Idaho on November 8, 2012:  my slides for this talk are on my home page.  The title was ``A brief history of type theory (or, more honestly, implementing mathematical objects as sets)".   

In 2005 I volunteered in the mathematics help room after school at Riverstone Community School weekly for a considerable period.  A lot of the help I gave was to the calculus teacher.

\item[Invited Research Presentations]

I have confined myself to presentations of papers given by invitation.

\begin{description}
\item[NF76 workshop, Cambridge University, 27 Mar-2 April 2013:]  This workshop at Cambridge University was organized by Thomas Forster; I was the principal speaker, and spoke for several days, as the primary purpose was for me to outline my claimed solution of the consistency problem for New Foundations.

\item[NF 75th Anniversary Workshop, 26-31 March 2012, University of Cambridge:]  I gave an invited talk titled "On the Canonical Model of a Symmetric Fragment of New Foundations". 

\item[University of Alberta, Sept 11 2012:]  I was invited to give a talk on a paper in preparation to the Department of Philosophy at the University of Alberta.   I presented ``A treatment of (some) functions in three types".

\item[University of Cambridge, June 26-27 2010]  I was invited to serve as external examiner at the  PhD defense of Dang Vu and give a talk to a seminar on New Foundations, titled "Symmetry Motivates a New Consistent Fragment of NF and an Extension of NF with Semantic Motivation".

\item[PM 100th Anniversary Workshop, Cambridge, November 27th-28th 2010:]   This was held at Trinity College, Cambridge, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the publication of the {\em Principia Mathematica\/} of Russell and Whitehead, a historical milestone for mathematical logic. I was surprised and very honored to be invited to this occasion, and gave a
presentation titled  ``Automating the ramified theory of types of Principia", reporting on information found in my publication 20 below, which I believe earned me the invitation.

\item[NF in the Bay Area, Stanford, June 25-27 2008:]  Invited to participate, and gave talks on  ``Symmetry as a criterion for comprehension motivating NF" (item 24 in my pubs list)  and on the paper now titled ``The usual model construction for NFU preserves information" (item 29).

\item[NF 70th Anniversary Meeting, 25-27 May 2007, University of Cambridge:]  I presented the paper ``A Forster Term Model of TST" (item 27).

\item[Workshop on the Urysohn Space, 21-24 May 2006]   The invitation to this workshop came as a bolt from the blue.  I had not thought much about this topic since submitting the research paper summarizing the results of my Masters thesis in 1992, but apparently it has attracted a fair amount of interest.  My presentation titled ``The Urysohn Space embeds in Banach Spaces in Just One Way"
(item 25) was an exposition based on my research paper from 1992 on this topic (item 2).

\item[presentation on New Foundations at Idaho State, 2005:]  Given by invitation from the COLD project there.

\item[AMS SE section meeting, Atlanta, March 8-10 2002:]  ``Mechanization of the System of the Principia Mathematica of Russell and Whitehead (preliminary report)'', invited talk given to a special session on Automated Reasoning.

\item[Istanbul Bilgi University, Istanbul, May 2002:]  invited to give talks on NF, ``Two talks on an alternative set theory"
(``Set Theory with a Universal Set
The Quine-Jensen Theory NFU" and ``Foundations of Mathematics in Polymorphic Type Theory"  (given May 31; one of these was pitched toward students and one toward faculty) and a talk titled ``The Watson Theorem Prover" for computer scientists.  I was there for a week.

\item[Free University of Brussels, Belgium Sept. 18-22, 2002:]  I was invited by the university to serve as an examiner at the Ph.D. defense of Armin Rigo and gave two talks -- ``The double extension set theory of Kiseielewicz is inconsistent" to the Logic Contact Group of the FNRS (Belgian national research organization) and ``Foundations of mathematics in polymorphic type theory" to the Belgian Society for Logic and Philosophy.

\item[Work in Progress]

These notes are miscellaneous and of varying levels of importance in my mind.

\begin{enumerate}

\item ``New Foundations is consistent".  I claim a proof of the consistency of New Foundations, which I presented at a meeting in Cambridge in March 2013.  It is not yet generally accepted that this is correct.  I am actively working in improvement of my presentation.   Professionals in the area are welcome to ask for access to the document; it is not to be shared further without informing me.

In this connection (2022) I have a new paper presenting a model of tangled type theory, as perhaps a more direct approach than the older approach using a tangled web.

\item  I have produced a theorem prover based on dependent types, similar to Automath, called Lestrade,
for which I have papers and extensive sample proofs in preparation.  In connection with this project, I also
have an implementation of the old Automath system itself.

\item I am planning to write a paper and have been writing testing
software on an efficient algorithm for bracket abstraction
(implementation of lambda calculus using combinators) which I
developed in 2005.  I have already communicated with Henk Barendregt,
an expert in this field, who seems to think that my approach has some
interest.

\item I have developed a sequent calculus prover implementing {\em
NFU\/} (following a formal presentation by Marcel Crabb\'e).  I used
this prover extensively (the logical rather than the set theoretical
aspects) in teaching Math 502, the graduate Logic and Set Theory
course, and in our second logic and discrete math course.  I used it
to a lesser extent to reinforce the initial review of formal proof in
our introductory real analysis course, and introduced it briefly in
our first logic and discrete math course.  I directed a graduate
student who wrote a Master's thesis about proof development in
elementary real analysis using the prover.   My
experience suggests that the prover does help at least some students to understand
formal proof, both in propositional logic and in the logic of
quantifiers.  The built in set theory has had some applications for
some students, but the fact that it is {\em NFU\/} has never actually
been important to a student user.  I have a project in mind to develop
a formal proof of Specker's theorem that Choice is false in {\em NF\/}
under the prover.

\item I have a project of implementation of the logic of Frege in a stratified version which avoids paradox,
with an associated theorem prover.  It is interesting to observe that the underlying type system used in this prover is essentially the same as that of Marcel though the provers appear quite different.  These two systems might be covered in a single paper.

\item An expanded version of ``Forcing in {\em NFU\/} and {\em
NF\/}'', listed above as appearing in a Festschrift in honor of
Maurice Boffa, should at some point be submitted to a refereed
journal.

\item I project a revision of my book {\em Elementary set theory with
a universal set\/}: currently it is out of print but I have permission
from the publishers to post it on the web.  The web version contains
various revisions and I am soliciting advice from others about needed
corrections.  I do not intend to extend this book, but write a second
monograph on a higher level; see the next item.  I did substantial revisions and corrections to the book in fall 2012, and will continue working on this.

\item A book on the consistent subsystems of {\em NF\/}: my current
plan is to write this as an extension of the existing notes I used to
teach foundations of mathematics to Boise State graduate students
starting with type theory rather than set theory.  I made some additions to this text during my sabbatical in Fall 2012.

\item The paper on the ramified theory of types of {\em Principia\/}
is accompanied by software implementing a complete polymorphic type
checker for the ramified theory of types.  I have considered writing a
proposal to implement some significant part of {\em Principia\/} using
this system.  I was invited in November 2010 to speak at a workshop
commemorating the 100th anniversary of the publication of {\em
Principia Mathematica\/}, due to my work in this area, and gave a
presentation whose slides should soon appear on my web page.

\item I have a new paper in preparation (2022) presenting models of NFU related to the very strong rank-into-rank large cardinal axioms.
