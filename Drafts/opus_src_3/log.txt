Log of changes to book

why do we get an error when LaTeX is run?  I may not be getting correct
updates.

Changes to chapter on Theory of Relations:  moved the Axiom of Projections
and Axiom of Diagonals earlier so that R^0 can be defined as [=].

Made Fourny corrections.  See following letter.

Dear Laurent,

Thanks very much for these comments!  You noticed some sillinesses which
I would _never_ catch.  Your comments on the material before the Representation
Theorem are wrong:  those notations are all as far as I can tell correct.
I'll be happy to explain in a separate letter, but I think you are perfectly
capable of working it out yourself...(but please request further comments if you
need them).

This is now corrected in my private copy -- I don't know if I will post this to the web now or later.

I continue unrepentant.

>l-3: (before exercises) "we will follow precedent and..." !?

Think about it.  I'm just saying that I provided Boolean union
by axiom and defined Boolean interesection with the assistance of that and other
axioms, so I will do the same with set union and intersection.

You are quite right.  Corrected (in my private version).

No, you are wrong.  Think it through.

That is a rather convoluted sentence...  (it does say the right thing,
but I will think about it).

>l20: "V^2" to be replaced by "V^(n+1)" and "V x $B&5(B!" by "$B&5(B! x V^n" ?

No, V^2 is correct.  As before, your proposed transposition is wrong.

>l25: "can be constructed as the domain" to be replaced by "can be

No, my formulation is correct.

I'll be happy to explain why you are wrong about various points above under separate
cover, but it would probably be more instructive to figure it out yourself.

I think that both of them proposed it, and it is implicit in earlier work --
in one sense, and in another sense it could not be even stated until the
notion of a first-order formula had been fully formalized, which happended much later.  In any event, I am under no obligation to reference that kind of thing in a book of this level.  The book is deliberately light
on references.

There are no references in the main body of the book.  This is a matter of policy.  But in this case you are right; I should reference this in the notes
for chapter 8.

is this a technical issue about a comma?

I'll leave it the way it is for now.

Right!!!!

The issue is whether a relation is a set of ordered pairs simply, or whether it is a triple<A,R,B> with domain and range as explicit components.  It is possible for a relation to be transitive and
symmetric but not reflexive if it is considered as having a domain larger
than its actual field.  With my definitions, a transitive symmetric relation must
be reflexive.

>p.74

Indeed, you are right...

I mean ZF.  I am entirely unrepentant about this :-)

I'm speaking to an audience which already knows what the natural numbers are (intuitively); I appeal to math induction because they already know what it is.  I then define what these terms mean "officially".  The last
statement you quote is ironic; of course no extra objects could be in all such sets.  In any event, no mathematics depends on this paragraph; everything that
I say officially is in the Definitions.

I can explain it to you, but I won't add anything about it to the book.
Unstratified math induction implies the Axiom of Counting (which is weaker)
and which already proves the existence of alpeh-omega, which does not follow
from the previous axioms.  Full unstratified induction has even stronger consequences,
all too technical for the book.  The real point is that all arithmetical
(or even type theory) applications of math induction are covered by stratified induction.

Right!!!

I wouldn't.

>l-1 I would remove "as before, so ... m+1 = n+1."

leave it alone...

>p.85

there's a reason.   x binds more
tightly than u, and the one case where I put a parenthesis it is needed to
manage the appearance of a union in the Cartesian product.

You are right:  m and n would be better.

>p.94

Ouch!

>p.95

No, we cannot.  This would readmit the closed intervals (-\infty,q]
which we need to exclude.

I address this, but in a slightly different way.
