On both sample test 1 papers, all questions are fair game.

On the sample test 2 paper, questions 1,2,3,6,7,8 are in principle fair game.  I have already remarked that
I am less likely to ask full dress proof questions, but I still may ask any of these...I dont promise not to ask you
to prove or explain anything :-)

On the sample test 2 review, what I say about sections 9,10,11,14 is relevant.
