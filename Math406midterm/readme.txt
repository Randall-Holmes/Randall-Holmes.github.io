What is relevant for your exam in the posted materials:

Everything in the test 1 papers and review is relevant.

In the test 2 review, the material on sections 9,10,11,14 is relevant.

I am less likely to ask proof questions for which you are going to be able to find
detailed answers in the book or my notes on this exam.  That doesn't mean that I
won't ask you to prove anything or explain it in terms of application of theorems.
