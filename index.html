 <h1>Overview of Randall Holmes's Home Page</h1>
 
 I'm (Melvin) Randall Holmes, a professor of mathematics at Boise State University in Boise Idaho since 1991.
 My research is in systems of set theory or combinatory logic related to Quine's set theory New Foundations, 
 with a sideline in computer-assisted reasoning.  I have a general somewhat more than amateur interest in the
 history and philosophy of mathematics, particularly mathematical logic.<p>
 
This is a version of my home page under my own control.  It largely mirrors but does not exactly mirror
 my current university home page.  
 It will contain some material found in my page at the university
 which will appear familiar;  other material (either outdated or inconvenient to import to the new location) will
 not be reproduced.  As I write (6/5/2020) the conversion process is only starting.  
 While it is in progress, many or most links will take you back to the original page.<p>

This is an implementation of the logic of Frege, made consistent by the application of stratification restrictions, as proposed by Nino Cocchiarella.  A curious fact is that the underlying logic is almost the same as that of the latest version of Marcel, though notationally it is very different as Frege's 2D notation is supported (for output only).<p>

<h2>NF Consistency Proof</h2>

I have claimed since 2010 to be in possession of a proof of the consistency of Quine's set theory New Foundations.  I maintain various versions of this proof here:  every now and then I have had to declutter this space.  The proof is complex and I freely admit to having severe problems with seeing how to present it.<p>

<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/newattempt.pdf">Here</A> is a fresh version from April 2020.  
  I am hoping this will be a bit easier to follow than earlier versions;  
  I do some clearly indicated foreshadowing of impossible things that turn out to be all true in the end, 
  which might help with motivation when I am doing the honest construction.<p>

<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/tangles.pdf">Here</A> is a purported draft of the proof of the existence of a model of tangled type theory (and thus of Con(NF)).<p>


As of 3/25/2017, I provide a key to versions.  (I) is an ancient version which I preserve because Nathan Bowler's group read it.  
  (II) is the version first submitted to a journal.  
  (IIa) corrects some problems with (II) that I found when preparing (III).  
  (III) is a version with a considerably simplified argument which has been presented to the journal as replacing (II).  
  (IIIa) is a version of (III) with a local correction to one argument.  
  (IV) is a further version with a simplified version of the construction of set parents already suggested in (I).<p>
  
  These numbered versions are all quite old now, and I would recommend sticking to the April 2020 version.<p>

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraftalt.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraftalt.pdf</TT> (III))</A> is what I think is a notably simplified version of the submitted version just below.  The structure built is exactly the same, but the bookkeeping of atoms in clans is slightly different, and the definition of the structure is given in a way which enormously simplifies the recursion in the definition and considerably simplifies the proofs that it works.  There still may be some need to revise text carried forward from the version below for compatibility with the new approach.  For the moment I am not making such corrections as this is the version now in the hands of referees; a version with such corrections might appear at this point if I become aware of a need for enough of them.<p>


<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraftalt-with-a-repair.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraftalt-with-a-repair.pdf</TT> (IIIa))</A> is the version at the top with a repair to the argument on pp. 38-42 with changes in the text indicated in the footnotes:  reasoning steps valid in <TT>submissiondraft.pdf</TT> because of global induction hypotheses have to be enforced by requiring that objects discussed be strongly symmetric.  Some other minor repairs have been made, indicated by footnotes.<p>

<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraftalt-smallparentsets.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraftalt-smallparentsets.pdf</TT> (IV))</A> is a version rewritten using the simpler definition of parent sets which is suggested in the other versions after the main construction.  There does seem to be some gain from using it.  The error fixed in the version just above was discovered while preparing this version (which doesn't have that issue because the argument for sizes of strongly symmetric power sets is a bit simpler).<p>

<p>


<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraft.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraft.pdf</TT> (II))</A> is a full version based on my working notes during my Cambridge visit in May and June 2016.  I believe this is the best approach.  There is no recursive horror of construction of codes for all the atoms and elements of the parent sets of atoms (if you have read those versions you know what I mean).  In fact, this version very much resembles the way I originally thought of the construction -- but with clearer understanding of how it goes, I believe I have avoided circular explanations.  It is still nasty.  This is the version which has been submitted to a journal.<p>

<A HREF ="https/Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraft-with-repairs.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraft-with-repairs.pdf</TT> (IIa))</A> is a version of the file immediately above which corrects or least remarks on slips in that version which I found in the course of preparing the version now at the top.  I commend the version at the top to the reader, but I continue to believe that the argument of this version is basically correct  and I'll maintain this for now and update it as required.  The argument in the version at the top is simplified, and the bookkeeping is being done differently, but the same system of clans and permutations is intended to be described.<p>

<p>


<LI>  <a href="http://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/tellthestory.pdf">Here (<TT>tellthestory.pdf</TT> (I))</a> is an older official document (using tangled webs), which uses quite complex coding.  This document has been read by Nathan Bowler's group in Hamburg, and they profess to understand most of it.  An error in the "elementarity argument" required a correction.   In the newer version above the whole issue of the "elementarity argument" is finessed.<p>

<LI>  If anyone wants information about the status of other versions previously posted here, please ask me.  I reduced them again in preparing the Github version of this page.

</UL>


If you have an amateur philosophical interest in NF, I do not think it likely that you will get anything out of these very technical and not yet very polished documents (in any version), and I am not likely to answer your questions about them. Be advised that in my opinion (which I know is not universal) the famed NF consistency problem has nothing at all to do with philosophical issues which Quine's set theory might be taken to address: I think that NFU addresses these issues to exactly the same extent and its consistency and mathematical strength have been settled issues since 1969.

</p><p>


<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/nftalk2013.pdf">Here</a>  is the talk I gave on New Foundations to the department at Boise State on September 10, 2013. Philosophical interests in NF might be served by these slides, and also by the notes on Frege's logic which appear below. 

<p><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/thehamburgslides.pdf">Here (<TT>theslides.pdf</TT>)</a> are the notes for the talk I 
gave at the University of Hamburg on June 24, 2015.  These have now been extended to a (quite long) full discussion of the proof -- this 
was done by incorporating a large final segment of the current version of the paper, which needs to be further formatted and cut.<p>

<p><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Papers/foundations3.pdf">This</a> is my most recent explicitly philosophical essay about Quine-style set theory.

<p> 6/4/2016 I have removed various items from here.  6/5/2020 I have removed more.  They still exist:  in fact, they are still in the directory pointed to by the links.  You may also inquire about them if you are interested.

</p><h2>My published book is available on-line in a corrected edition</h2>

I have permission from my publisher to post a revised version of my book Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set 
 (which has gone out of print) online. This <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/head.pdf">PDF version</a> 
 is the result of a first pass through the text in November 2012 with the aim of preparing an official online second edition. 
 I thank my publishers for their kindness in allowing me to maintain an online version, 
 both to conveniently publicize error corrections and to make the work available now that it is out of print.<p>

Communications about errors and infelicities would be very welcome!<p>

<h2>Drafts of Current Work</h2>

Here is <A HREF="Drafts/nfuexplanation.pdf">a talk</A> I gave recently to the local seminar on resolving the paradoxes in NFU.
 There isn't anything very novel about it:  it was really intended as an example to address questions by a philosopher about
 whether discussions of avoidance of the paradoxes are explanations of why we regard a theory as reliable (the usual way in 
 which resolutions of the paradoxes in NFU are discussed is not really motivated in this way).  
 Here are <A HREF="Drafts/typedfoundations.pdf">some notes</A> about foundations in type theory and NF(U) which are 
 altogether more serious in intent, although they should be regarded as a negative indexed draft which might contain
 genuine howlers ;-)<p>

Here is the brief demonstration that parameter-free Zermelo set theory is the same as full Zermelo set theory:  
 <a href="Drafts/parameterfree.pdf">parameterfree.pdf</a><p>

Here is <a href="Drafts/functionsin3dorder-submitted.pdf">my submitted draft (2018)</a> 
 on representation of functions in third order logic (this paper has appeared).  
 <a href="Drafts/functionsin3dorder-best-slides.pdf">Here</a> 
 are the slides for my BEST talk about this.<p>
 
 <p>
<a href="Drafts/pmsemantics.pdf">Here</a> find an outline of a proposed approach to semantics for 
  the Principia Mathematica (PM) of Russell and Whitehead using the type and substitution algorithms 
  in my paper on automated polymorphic type inference in PM.  
  <a href="Drafts/notesonpm.pdf">Here</a> find some notes on PM with page references related to the same analysis.<p>

<A HREF = "Draft/pm-no-compromise.pdf">Here</A> find an essay on the ontological commitments of PM
 and why substitutional quantification does work there and doesn't save you from serious ontological commitments.
 The flavor of my remarks is admittedly rather bad-tempered; a great deal of nonsense is written about PM.

<p>


<a href="Gottlob/fregenote.pdf">Here</a> find an outline of how to fix the foundational system of Frege 
 using stratification in the style of Quine.  <a href="Gottlob/frege2.pdf">Here</a>
 find another approach to the same subject.  
 <a href="Gottlob/gottlob.html">Here</a> find a computer implementation of these ideas.

</p><p>

<a href="Drafts/zfcminusext.pdf">Here</a> find my current notes on Dana Scott's 
 lovely and weird result that ZFC minus extensionality has the same strength as Zermelo set theory.

</p><p>

<a href="Drafts/acyclic_abstract_final_revision.pdf">Here</a>
 is the May 19th 2011 (submitted) version of the paper I am writing about Zuhair al-Johar's 
 proposal of "acyclic comprehension", with Zuhair and Nathan Bowler as co-authors, 
 a perhaps surprising reformulation of stratified comprehension.

</p><p>

<a href="Drafts/symmetryrevisited.pdf">Here</a>  is the submitted (2020) draft of the paper I am writing about
 a simpler form of symmetric comprehension equivalent to NF.  <a href="Drafts/symmetryrevisited2.pdf">Here</a> is a companion piece
 describing a weaker version of symmetric comprehension which gives a theory inessentially stronger than NF3, with a model construction.<p>
 

</p><p>

<a href="Drafts/hereditary.pdf">Here</a>
 find the note submitted Dec 30 2013 on my result that the set H(|X|) of all sets hereditarily smaller in size than a set X exists, not using Choice. It is surprising to me that this is not an obvious result, but the references for partial results that I have been able to find are recent, so perhaps it is new.

</p><p>

</p><p>

<a href="Drafts/hierarchy.pdf">Here</a> find a summary of my thoughts 
 on the correct default foundations in the style of Zermelo.  
 In spite of being an NF-iste, I do think that Zermelo-style foundations are the best.  
 However, I think that the axiom of replacement is so strong that it should not be part of the default foundations. 
 In particular, I do not think that the axiom of replacement is justified by the intuition of the cumulative hierarchy; 
 it is a far stronger principle.

</p><p>



Here is a <a href="Drafts/preserves3.pdf">version</a> of my paper on the curious fact that 
 the urelements in the usual models of NFU turn out to be inhomogeous, because the membership 
 relation on the underlying model-with-automorphism of the usual set theory turns out to be 
 definable in NFU terms.  This version corrects a couple of annoying typos in the published version.

</p><h2>Loglan, an artificial human language</h2>

For several years, I have been the "chief executive officer" (a grander designation than is perhaps appropriate) of The Loglan Institute, the nonprofit organization which attempts to guide the development of the artificial language Loglan. This language was originally proposed by James Cooke Brown in the 1950's as a vehicle for testing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (look it up!) A specific peculiarity of this language is that it is (at least in intention) syntactically unambiguous: the official version of the language is unambiguously machine parsable. The language is intended to be highly logical: it is to some extent an implementation of first-order logic in a spoken language.

<p>

Here is <a href="http://www.loglan.org/">the official web site of the Loglan
Institute</a>. Here is <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/loglan.org/welcome.html">the mirror of
the Loglan web site here at Boise State</a>. There is access to a wide variety of information, documents and software through these links.

</p><p>

<a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/loglan.org/holmes_stuff/cefli.html">Here</a>
 is my new separate page on Loglan, where you can find pointers to my current Loglan projects.

</p><h2>Watson Theorem Prover Project</h2>

Here is the link to the page for my old theorem prover project Watson: <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/proverpage.html">Watson
theorem prover page.</a> I am planning to incorporate some features of this system into my current project. This project was funded for some time by the Department of Defense; I have not worked directly on it for years, but I have not forgotten about it entirely.

<h2>Education in Virtual Worlds?</h2>


Note the question mark. I'm not gung ho on this subject, but I have spent
some time investigating the question of whether and how well mathematics (and
other content) could be taught in online environments such as <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. I participated in the class <a href="http://lisadawley.googlepages.com/597SLsyllabus.htm">Teaching and
Learning in Second Life</a> taught by Lisa <span class="SpellE">Dawley</span> in
the Boise State Educational Technology Program in 2009 (?). I think a major
(perhaps the major) technical problem with teaching math in SL has to do with
the difficulty of freehand drawing in SL, and I developed a tool in Second Life
which (almost) addresses this. There is a <a href="http://sl.nmc.org/2008/01/10/challenges-solutions-day2/">blog entry</a>
about a presentation on this problem. In spring 2010 I taught a class in SL
called Teaching Mathematics in Virtual Worlds, through the Educational
Technology Department here. I'm currently practicing my <span class="SpellE">Loglan</span>
in weekly conversation meetings in Second Life, but not there much otherwise; I
remain interested in doing some experiments on representing Calculus III
concepts in the 3D virtual world.

<h2>The Strictly False Programming Language (frivolous)</h2>



I have designed an eccentric programming language (Strictly False) an
extension of Wouter van Oortmerssen's
elegant <a href="http://wouter.fov120.com/false/">False
programming language</a>. The source (in Standard ML) is <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/purefalse.sml">here</a> and the
documentation (PDF) is <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/sfdocs.pdf">here.</a>. Any BSU
student who writes a program in False or Strictly False which does something
interesting can come and see me for praise [you can get a DOS False interpreter
off the site I cite; to run my interpreter (and my language is definitely more
powerful), you need <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html">Moscow ML</a>].

<h2>The Definition of Planet (frivolous)</h2>

Definitions are important to mathematicians, and fools rush in where angels fear to tread, so <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/planet.html">here</a> find my modest proposal for the definition of "planet" with comments on why the definitions lately proposed by the IAU are not so good.
