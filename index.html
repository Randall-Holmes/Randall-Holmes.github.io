 I'm (Melvin) Randall Holmes, a professor of mathematics at Boise State University in Boise Idaho since 1991.
 My research is in systems of set theory or combinatory logic related to Quine's set theory New Foundations, 
 with a sideline in computer-assisted reasoning.  I have a general somewhat more than amateur interest in the
 history and philosophy of mathematics, particularly mathematical logic.<p>

<h2>NF Consistency Proof</h2>
  
  <CENTER><EM>I have discovered the consistency of New Foundations -- it is like custard!</EM>:  Jesse Holmes</CENTER><p>

I have claimed since 2010 to be in possession of a proof of the consistency of Quine's set theory New Foundations.  I maintain various versions of this proof here:  every now and then I have had to declutter this space.  The proof is complex and I freely admit to having severe problems with seeing how to present it.<p>

Different versions of this argument use different notation and terminology.  It is at bottom the same argument (even when a model of tangled type theory is the target rather than the construction of s tangled web of cardinals).  It is nasty to present and I am always thinking about how I might make it more approachable.<p>

The formal verification of my proof of Con(NF) in Lean has been completed, by Sky Wilshaw, a Part III student at Cambridge who is about to go on to her doctoral studies in Computer Science.
<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/maybedetangled2.pdf">Here</A> is a version of the paper proof which is being edited to conform better with the approach that Sky took in the formalization.
I have verified the conclusions of the formal argument in Lean:  it shows that there is a structure for the language of tangled type theory which satisfies all typed versions of statements in the finite axiomatization of NF due to Hailperin,
which entails that it is in fact a model of tangled type theory, and so that New Foundations is consistent.  This version of the paper proof is still being edited to conform with the formalization,
but a first pass has been completed so I'm ready to display it.  The formalized proof is still extremely nasty and complicated;  Sky is working on tidying it up, but it resists essential simplification just as all paper versions have.
It is, however, reliably correct.   There is a lot of work still to be done to clean things up, but success in proving this theorem can be reported.<p>


<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/maybedetangled.pdf">Here</A> is a version which is in general terms similar to the one below (a tangled type theory construction) but involves a systematic technical change which seems to simplify matters considerably.  The new technical concepts grew out of the Lean development (the change to the domains of f maps is due to a suggestion by Sky Wilshaw, the current Lean worker) but the Lean project is still driven by the version below.  (initially posted 11/17/2023), will be under revision).<p>

<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/retangled.pdf">Here</A> is the version of the proof (a tangled type theory approach, 
 the description in the Wisconsin slides, probably best yet) being used to attempt verification of the proof in Lean.  This version is intended to replace the one below, but it involves
 considerable changes and the old version may be needed for debugging and reconciliation.
 The datestamp on the paper should be consulted:  this one will continue to be updated regularly (August 9 2022 initial release).   On 11/17/2023 I am posting a version of this which is rather sketchy, as the previous posted version contained a serious gap.  The gap is fixed in this version but the fix is rather messy;  the situation is clearer in the version above [the problem was with the articulation of the argument for the size of types].  The gap was probably introduced when this version was created initially; I suspect that I oversimplified something in translation from the previous version.<p>
 
 It may interest readers to know that the construction has been formalized, and the verification of its properties has been verified up to completion of the proof of the Freedom of Action theorem.  We are still at work on the proof of the sizes of types.<p>

<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/untangled.pdf">Here</A> is a now probably superseded version of the proof (a tangled type theory approach, 
 the description in the Wisconsin slides, probably best yet) being used to attempt verification of the proof in Lean.   The version above repairs an error and systematically changes the framework.  
 The datestamp on the paper should be consulted:  this one will be updated regularly during my Cambridge visit in May/June 2022 
 (writing in May 2022).<p>

<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/wiscslides.pdf">Here</A> are the slides for the talk given on Zoom at the University of Wisconsin, 4/25/2022.<p>



<!--
<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/nfconcept3.pdf">Here</A> is (without too firm a warranty) a paper which describes a direct construction of a model of tangled type theory.  I am posting this for the benefit of those contemplating whether a verification of the proof in Lean is feasible.  This one is recent enough that debugging may well be required.<p>

<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/newfoundationsfall21.pdf">Here</A> is (without too firm a warranty) a newer draft paper describing the construction of a tangled web of cardinals.

-->

The following is the last full version of the tangled webs approach, which I preserve for reference.  I now think that building a model of tangled type theory is much more manageable.
<p>
<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/newattempt.pdf">Here</A> is a fresh version from April 2020.  
  I am hoping this will be a bit easier to follow than earlier versions;  
  I do some clearly indicated foreshadowing of impossible things that turn out to be all true in the end, 
  which might help with motivation when I am doing the honest construction.<p>
  
  I am for the moment, in the interests of focus, making other older versions invisible.<p>
  
<!--
<A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/tangles.pdf">Here</A> is a purported draft of the proof of the existence of a model of tangled type theory (and thus of Con(NF)).<p>


As of 3/25/2017, I provide a key to versions.  (I) is an ancient version which I preserve because Nathan Bowler's group read it.  
  (II) is the version first submitted to a journal.  
  (IIa) corrects some problems with (II) that I found when preparing (III).  
  (III) is a version with a considerably simplified argument which has been presented to the journal as replacing (II).  
  (IIIa) is a version of (III) with a local correction to one argument.  
  (IV) is a further version with a simplified version of the construction of set parents already suggested in (I).<p>
  
  These numbered versions are all quite old now, and I would recommend sticking to the April 2020 version.<p>

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraftalt.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraftalt.pdf</TT> (III))</A> is what I think is a notably simplified version of the submitted version just below.  The structure built is exactly the same, but the bookkeeping of atoms in clans is slightly different, and the definition of the structure is given in a way which enormously simplifies the recursion in the definition and considerably simplifies the proofs that it works.  There still may be some need to revise text carried forward from the version below for compatibility with the new approach.  For the moment I am not making such corrections as this is the version now in the hands of referees; a version with such corrections might appear at this point if I become aware of a need for enough of them.<p>


<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraftalt-with-a-repair.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraftalt-with-a-repair.pdf</TT> (IIIa))</A> is the version at the top with a repair to the argument on pp. 38-42 with changes in the text indicated in the footnotes:  reasoning steps valid in <TT>submissiondraft.pdf</TT> because of global induction hypotheses have to be enforced by requiring that objects discussed be strongly symmetric.  Some other minor repairs have been made, indicated by footnotes.<p>

<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraftalt-smallparentsets.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraftalt-smallparentsets.pdf</TT> (IV))</A> is a version rewritten using the simpler definition of parent sets which is suggested in the other versions after the main construction.  There does seem to be some gain from using it.  The error fixed in the version just above was discovered while preparing this version (which doesn't have that issue because the argument for sizes of strongly symmetric power sets is a bit simpler).<p>

<p>


<LI> <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraft.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraft.pdf</TT> (II))</A> is a full version based on my working notes during my Cambridge visit in May and June 2016.  I believe this is the best approach.  There is no recursive horror of construction of codes for all the atoms and elements of the parent sets of atoms (if you have read those versions you know what I mean).  In fact, this version very much resembles the way I originally thought of the construction -- but with clearer understanding of how it goes, I believe I have avoided circular explanations.  It is still nasty.  This is the version which has been submitted to a journal.<p>

<A HREF ="https/Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/submissiondraft-with-repairs.pdf">This (<TT>submissiondraft-with-repairs.pdf</TT> (IIa))</A> is a version of the file immediately above which corrects or least remarks on slips in that version which I found in the course of preparing the version now at the top.  I commend the version at the top to the reader, but I continue to believe that the argument of this version is basically correct  and I'll maintain this for now and update it as required.  The argument in the version at the top is simplified, and the bookkeeping is being done differently, but the same system of clans and permutations is intended to be described.<p>

<p>


<LI>  <a href="http://Randall-Holmes.github.io/Nfproof/tellthestory.pdf">Here (<TT>tellthestory.pdf</TT> (I))</a> is an older official document (using tangled webs), which uses quite complex coding.  This document has been read by Nathan Bowler's group in Hamburg, and they profess to understand most of it.  An error in the "elementarity argument" required a correction.   In the newer version above the whole issue of the "elementarity argument" is finessed.<p>

<LI>  If anyone wants information about the status of other versions previously posted here, please ask me.  I reduced them again in preparing the Github version of this page.

If you have an amateur philosophical interest in NF, I do not think it likely that you will get anything out of these very technical 
and not yet very polished documents (in any version), and I am not likely to answer your questions about them. 
Be advised that in my opinion (which I know is not universal) the famed NF consistency problem has nothing at 
all to do with philosophical issues which Quine's set theory might be taken to address: 
I think that NFU addresses these issues to exactly the same extent 
and its consistency and mathematical strength have been settled issues since 1969.

 <p>
 <img src="cover-art.png" width="200" align="top">  The place to start...
 <p>

For several years, I have been the "chief executive officer" (a grander designation than is perhaps appropriate) of The Loglan Institute, the nonprofit organization which attempts to guide the development of the artificial language Loglan. This language was originally proposed by James Cooke Brown in the 1950's as a vehicle for testing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (look it up!) A specific peculiarity of this language is that it is (at least in intention) syntactically unambiguous: the official version of the language is unambiguously machine parsable. The language is intended to be highly logical: it is to some extent an implementation of first-order logic in a spoken language.

<p>

Here is <a href="http://www.loglan.org/">the official web site of the Loglan
Institute</a>. Here is <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/loglan.org/welcome.html">the mirror of
the Loglan web site at Boise State</a>. There is access to a wide variety of information, documents and software through these links.

<h2>Education in Virtual Worlds?</h2>
<!-- <p>
 <img src="Teacher 1.png" width="200" align="top"> Professor Leslie Beaumont examines a 
 student creation on EdTech Island, the former Boise State extension in Second Life.
 
 <p> -->

Note the question mark. I'm not gung ho on this subject, but I have spent
some time investigating the question of whether and how well mathematics (and
other content) could be taught in online environments such as <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. I participated in the class <a href="http://lisadawley.googlepages.com/597SLsyllabus.htm">Teaching and
Learning in Second Life</a> taught by Lisa <span class="SpellE">Dawley</span> in
the Boise State Educational Technology Program in 2009 (?). I think a major
(perhaps the major) technical problem with teaching math in SL has to do with
the difficulty of freehand drawing in SL, and I developed a tool in Second Life
which (almost) addresses this.  In spring 2010 I taught a class in SL
called <a href ="Teaching Math in Virtual Worlds.html">Teaching Mathematics in Virtual Worlds</a>, through the Educational
 Technology Department here. Here are <a href = "TMVW talk slides.odp">the slides</a> for a talk I gave about this class at the VWBPE conference in SL in 2011(?).  I'm currently practicing my <span class="SpellE">Loglan</span>
in weekly conversation meetings in Second Life, but not there much otherwise; I
remain interested in doing some experiments on representing Calculus III
concepts in the 3D virtual world.

<h2>The Strictly False Programming Language (frivolous)</h2>



I have designed an eccentric programming language (Strictly False) an
extension of Wouter van Oortmerssen's
elegant <a href="http://wouter.fov120.com/false/">False
programming language</a>. The source (in Standard ML) is <a href="purefalse.sml">here</a> and the
documentation (PDF) is <a href="sfdocs.pdf">here.</a>. Any BSU
student who writes a program in False or Strictly False which does something
interesting can come and see me for praise [you can get a DOS False interpreter
off the site I cite; to run my interpreter (and my language is definitely more
powerful), you need <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html">Moscow ML</a>].
