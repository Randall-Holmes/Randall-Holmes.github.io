 Inspector Lestrade makes an arrest...perhaps on suspicion of an invalid reasoning step?
 
 <p>
This page provides resources related to a current little project of 
mine, whose motivation is actually philosophical.  I have in mind a view
 of the philosophy of mathematics under which the objects of classical, 
nonconstructive, impredicative mathematics with higher orders of 
infinity are naturally accessible by finitary means, all the infinities 
being merely potential.  This view exploits the Curry Howard isomorphism
 and some thoughts of mine about the nature of abstraction, and if it is
 to be taken seriously should be implementable on a computer.   The 
implementation (given the intellectual ingredients I have mentioned) 
should resemble Automath.  And it does.

<p>An implementation is now found here with documentation and examples.

</p><p>
The name is admittedly a bit of mischief:  I am Holmes, I already have a
 prover called Watson, and my son suggested that I call this one 
Lestrade...

<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\lestrade.sml">Here</a>
 is the source for the  original implementation in Moscow ML 2.01 of the Lestrade
 Type Inspector.  The version date is shown in the files.  As of 10/14/2017 this differs by one character from a 
LaTex document <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\lestradesource.pdf">here</a> (literate programming attempted):  the idea is that I can maintain a readably commented source in this way.</p><p>

I no longer support multiple versions.  It is useful to be aware that after July 2019 what was the <TT>construct</TT> command is now the <TT>postulate</TT> command and <TT>rewritec</TT> has become <TT>rewritep</TT>.  Those two string replaces will likely fix any old files.  Most if perhaps not all of the Lestrade source files on this page have been edited and tested with the current version and should run.  I might have missed one or two.</p><p>

There have been significant updates to display and file handling during the development of the Zermelo implementation.<p>

There is a complete reimplementation discussed below.<p>



<H3> Substantial papers and manual drafts </H3>

<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\dependent_types.pdf">Here</a>
 is a paper I was working on in summer 2016, containing an outline of the
 philosophical approach, an account of the commands and the formal 
language of Lestrade, and extensive sample Lestrade books.  <b>This is the best current approximation to a manual and qua manual has been kept up to date.</b></p><p>

The files which follow embody the largest Lestrade implementation project, now underway (summer 2019).  I am implementing Zermelo's 1908 papers on axiomatization of set theory and proof of the well-ordering theorem.<p>
<UL>
<LI><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\whatismath1.pdf">Here</a> are the logical preliminaries.<p>

<LI><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\whatismath2.pdf">Here</a> is the axiomatics of 1908 Zermelo set theory, anachronistically provided with a proof of the basic property of the Kuratowski pair (but this is not used in our quite faithful implementation of the 1908 well ordering theorem proof).<p>

<LI><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\whatismath5.pdf">Here</a> are consequences of the big result of file 4;  I expect this file to eventually contain the final result.  I am still working on it.  The sheer size of file 4 forced me to perfect the ability to load and develop files incrementally (Lestrade already had some support for this, but it was awkward and limited;  it is improved, of necessity).<p>

The Lestrade scripts have the same names with a .tex extension instead of .pdf (literate programming at work:  the same files are fed to LaTeX to produce the documents above and to Lestrade to run the proofs) and are in the same directory.<p>

<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade conference paper\newestcls.pdf">Here</a> is a conference paper I submitted to a workshop in 2018, discussing both Lestrade and Automath.

 is an old manual (which I updated for a while but which doesn't have 
the latest changes; it does not say everything that the paper designated
 as the manual above says, but it has a different emphasis and I think 
it might still be useful).  The .tex source in the same directory is an executable Lestrade script.</p><p>

<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\zermelo.pdf">Here</a> is an axiomatization of ZFC in Lestrade.  Not of much interest until I prove something with it!</p><p>

<a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\fibonacci.pdf">Here</a>
 is a paper I am working on in fall 2017, exhibiting the rewriting 
capabilities, and the ability to use rewrite rules provably valid in a 
theory to implement programming behavior:  the file is intended to 
support computation of Fibonacci numbers (thus the name) but at the 
moment supports a fully implemented adder for binary numerals on top of a
 simple theory of arithmetic:  all of its computations are theorems.  
The <tt>rewrited</tt> command, not witnessed so far in other files, is used extensively in this one.</p><p>



And <a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\discretemath.pdf">here</a>
 is another paper I am working on in fall 2016, which pretends to be an 
initial segment of an elementary discrete math test supported by 
Lestrade text.</p><p>

The new version has the same input language (except that it does not support rewriting) but a quite different file format.  There is a utility for exporting files from the first version, and files from the first version which do not use rewriting can now reliably be revised to run under the second version:  all the files for the proof of the well-ordering theorem have been converted, as have the examples embedded in my large papers.  There are some differences in the parser and in move saving and implicit argument inference which require occasional changes.<p>

<H3>An implementation of Automath itself</H3>

Here is <A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\automath\automathmanual.pdf">the documentation</A> and the (Python) <A HREF="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\automath\automath-flagship-4-2.py">source</A> 
for an actual implementation of Automath.  It runs the classic long Automath <A HREF ="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\automath/grundlagen.aut1">example</A>, an implementation 
of Landau's little arithmetic book.  It must be noted that it takes hours to run the Landau book, where Freek Wiedijk's implementation takes seconds;  
but it does have some interest.  <A HREF = "https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\automath/newestcls.pdf"<p>Here</a> is a paper (submitted to a conference but not accepted) which discusses the relationship
between Lestrade and Automath.

</p><h2> Script files</h2>

Lestrade scripts have the extension .lti (.ltxt for the new version) and should be opened with a 
text editor.  They are executable by Lestrade itself using the readfile 
command, and they are produced by Lestrade as log files.   Some of these
 files are things I am working on which will continue to be updated.  The use of .lti files is superseded for the most part by the use of executable .tex files as Lestrade scripts.<p>

<li><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\russell.lti">russell.lti</a> is a self-contained implementation of Russell's paradox.  Needless to say, there are <b>assumptions</b> which lead to the paradox; the logic of Automath itself is consistent.

</li><li><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\landau_axioms.lti">landau_axioms.lti</a>
 is my ongoing implementation of Landau's Foundations of Analysis 
(following in the footsteps of the original Automath project).  I'm 
currently in the middle of proposition 4.  This is not a polished 
production; I am hacking as I go.  It will get cleaned up later!  [This 
is a stalled project from summer 2015, but I have made a little progress
 on it recently].<p>

</li><li><a href="https://Randall-Holmes.github.io\Lestrade\Lestrade and Automath (backups)\Lestrade 1\rewrites.lti">rewrites.lti</a>
 is a new set of declarations I am working on in summer 2016.  This is 
to be run with the new version of Lestrade with rewriting, and exhibits 
elementary examples of rewrite rule programming, similar
in style to that found in Watson.  I want to develop examples where 
rewrite rules are demonstrated on the basis of proofs rather than 
introduced by fiat, but the rewrite construction command is a perfectly 
reasonable way to introduce an equational axiom -- if one is willing for
 it always to be applied as a simplification.
