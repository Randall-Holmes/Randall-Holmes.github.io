\title{A concrete approach to mathematics?}

\maketitle

In this essay we consider a view of the modern mathematics of the continuous and the infinite which views the objects and the arguments of mathematics as objects which can be concretely presented as inhabitants of data types representable in practice on a computer.   We illustrate this using actual general purpose software with this aim.

The software we use is called the Lestrade Type Inspector, implementing a formal system called Lestrade.  We will initially present Lestrade code in contexts where it is clear what it does.  A formal description will eventually appear.

The ontology for mathematics (and mathematical arguments) that we employ is typed.  Mathematical objects do come in kinds.  Both new objects and new sorts of objects can be introduced in Lestrade theory development, as we will see.

We begin with logic.
